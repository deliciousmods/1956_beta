# Muhammad Mahmoud Al-Zubairi, born in 1910 poet and revolutionary against the monarchy (was in Egypt at the time until 1941 and then was arrested until 42). He established the "Free Yemeni Party" (also translated as the "Liberal Party") in 1944 Minister of Knowledge during the revolution in 1948
# Ahmad al Muta: advocate for reform, expelled from the army and as editor of the official newspaper because of his ideas. met and befriended Ahmad Muhammad Numan in the mid 30's
# Ahmad Muhammad Numan was a Yemeni educator, propagandist and politician. He was one of the main progenitors of modern Yemeni nationalism. Numan was the founder of the Free Yemeni Movement and served as foreign minister and then prime minister in the 60's
# In 1936 the Imam dispatched his son Sayf al-Islam Qasim to visit the school. Accompanying him were the Governor of Ta'izz Sayyid Ali al-Wazir and the poet Muhammad al-Zubayri. The report must have pleased the Imam inasmuch as he recommended it to an Egyptian education delegation.[7] Complaints from conservatives, however, led to the appointment of a traditional instructor to teach Zaidi doctrines.[9] And when the Imam's secret police discovered the Hay'at al Nidal and arrested al-Muta (in 1936), Numan was placed under house arrest in Ta'izz.
# Abdullah bin Ahmad al-Wazir -> imam chosen by the al wazir coup attempt.
# Yahia al-Iryani, was the Chief Judge of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen
#
# Sayyid'Abd Allâh al-Wazîr commanded an army to repress a revolt in 1923, Then again in 1930 = abdullah?
# Ahmad Hamîd al-Dîn crush another tribal revolt in 26-27
#
# Treaties: Italy in 1925 (renewed october 15 1937), USSR in 1928 (friendship and trade). 1931 Treaties of frienship with Iraq, 1933 with HOL, 1935 with ETH, April 1936 with France, December 1936 with BEL
# 1934: signature of a treaty between the imam and the governor of Aden to stop claims for 40 years and cease yemeni raids. Trade with Aden blocked in 32 resumes
# Italian representation is the strongest. Lead by the doctor of the Imam Dr. Emilio Dubbiosi, but he returned to Italy in 1938. It was certainly fascism oriented though.
# 2 Syrian pashas in exile were helping the Yemeni army at the time, trained by the turks and knowing german and French (at least one of them)
# One soviet woman stayed until 1938, it could be renewed.
