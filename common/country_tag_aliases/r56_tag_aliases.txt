# tag aliases are country tags that maps to different countries depending on a set of triggers

#TAG = { #name of alias tag. must be 3 letters and different from any other tags. once this is defined, it will be available in any script that uses country tags

#	# if any of these are used, the alias will be mapped to that specific variable/event target and no other check will be done

#	global_event_target = event_target_name
#	event_target = event_target_name
#
#	# if an alias is not mapped directly to a variable/event target, it will be searched within a list of countries that can be definied below
#	# you can use any combination of these below
#	# while checking for triggers/variables, current scope will be the country we are checking and PREV will be the scope that uses the alias
#	# if none of the following targets are defined, the game will check all existing countries but this is highly discouraged for performance reasons
#	original_tag = GER # pick a country that has original_tag of GER
#	targets = { GER FRA ENG } # search within the list of tags/variables
#	target_array = array_name # search within an array
