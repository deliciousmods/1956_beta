### UNIT RATIOS
# AIR
# For air types unit_ratio strategy values behave like weights. If no value is set it defaults to 0. If a plane type is DLC locked its set ratio is ignored and 0 is used instead.
# 
# Land-based and carrier plane types are handled completely separate.
# 
# First we calculate the total number of planes that the AI want to produce:
# 
# For land-based planes:
# - Sum up the total air base capacity (excluding carriers), and multiply it by WANTED_LAND_PLANES_PER_BASE_CAPACITY_FACTOR.
# - Add the number of divisions the AI wants multiplied by WANTED_LAND_PLANES_PER_DIVISION.
# - Subtract the number of planes in airwings.
# - Clamp the value between 0 and the number of wanted divisions multiplied by WANTED_LAND_PLANES_TOTAL_MAX_PER_DIVISION.
# - The result is then multiplied by hardcoded value AI_FOCUS_AVIATION, which beforehand has been multiplied by modifier ai_focus_aviation_factor.
# 
# For carrier planes:
# - Sum up the total carrier deck capacity, and multiply it by WANTED_CARRIER_PLANES_PER_CARRIER_CAPACITY_FACTOR.
# - Sum up the total deck capacity of carriers in production, where the carrier will be done in no more than CARRIER_CAPACITY_IN_PRODUCTION_MAX_DAYS_LEFT_TO_INCLUDE_FACTOR days, and multiply it by WANTED_CARRIER_PLANES_PER_CARRIER_CAPACITY_IN_PRODUCTION_FACTOR.
# - Subtract the number of carrier planes in airwings.
# - Clamp the value to minimum 0.
# - The result is then multiplied by hardcoded value AI_FOCUS_NAVAL_AIR, which beforehand has been multiplied by modifier ai_focus_naval_air_factor.
# 
# Finally we calculate and set the build_airplane strategy values:
# - For each land-based type we take the unit_ratio, divide it by the sum of all land-based unit_ratio values, and multiply it by the above calculated number of wanted land-based planes.
# - We do the same for carrier planes.
# 
# ALL BUT AIR
# Unit ratios are calculated as a base of 100 plus the value indicated in the strategy.
# A unit type ratio of -40 would result in only 60% of the wanted number being set as a goal
# how the AI meets its goals thereafter can also be altered by other factors.

### EQUIPMENT PRODUCTION FACTOR
# Same as above, with the percentage of calculated factories to meet need added to by the strategy

### Examples of AI strategy usage ###

# Example of strategy for intelligence agency
#example_strategy = {
#
#	enable = {
#		original_tag = FRA
#	}
#
#	ai_strategy = {
#		type = intelligence_agency_usable_factories
#		# no need of id for this one
#		value = 10
#	}
#
#	ai_strategy = {
#		type = intelligence_agency_branch_desire_factor
#		id = branch_defense
#		value = -50    # -50% on the AI weight
#	}
#}

# Example of strategy for avoid_starting_wars
#example_strategy = {
#
#	enable = {
#		original_tag = FRA
#	}
#
#	ai_strategy = {
#		type = avoid_starting_wars
#		# no need of id for this one
#		value = -200 # this value is additive with the 'conquer' strategy, and is targetless. It is meant for very specific situations, and should not be used widely.
#	}
#
#	ai_strategy = {
#		type = conquer
#		id = GER
#		value = 200 # This would therefore stack with the above value to reach a conquer weight of 0 for targeting Germany, and -200 for everyone else.
#	}
#}


# example unit buffer strategy. this strategy will make ai buffer/garrison some units in a target area  which can be used in orders that is in target areas
#
# ai_strategy = {
# 	type = put_unit_buffers
#
#	# ratio of total armeis in country to be buffered
# 	ratio = 0.4

# 	# states to put garrison orders (if no state is friendly, strat is invalid)
# 	states = {
# 		125
# 		126
# 		127
# 		128
# 		129
# 		338
# 		123
# 		122
# 	}
#
#	# ai areas that the orders will use these buffers in
# 	area = europe
# 	area = asia
#
# 	# by default if you have orders in target areas, the buffer will request less units.
#	# you can override this to disable the feature
# 	subtract_invasions_from_need = yes
