Road to 56 Beta Build

This is the Readme guide for using Github with Road to 56.

Sign up with Github if you haven't already, and request membership/team assignment from Greatexperiment via Discord.
Download the desktop client from Github.
In the program, File -> Clone -> URL -> deliciousmods/1956_beta.
Set the local directory as your documents > Paradox Interactive > Hearts of Iron IV > mod folder.
Clone the project and download.
Be sure to create a .mod file or use the one included in the 1956_beta folder.
Create a personal branch of the mod via Branch -> New branch in the client.
Be sure to periodically go to 'Branch -> Update from beta-edits' to keep your files up to date.
All edits you make will automatically display in the client. If you are sure of your changes, put your handle in the summary box and a summary of your work in the description section.
Lastly, use the push button in the client to add your files to your branch.
When you are done, you must request that your work be reviewed and added to the main mod. You do this via Branch -> Create pull request. Once accepted, your work will be in the mod.
Add your changes to the patch notes on the wiki.
Also, check our wiki for all the standards we use. The file structure of 56 is not the same as vanilla, and we have some unusual naming conventions. If you don't follow these, there will be severe bugs and errors. Remember, only you can stop forest fires!

If, for some reason, you need greater access rights to the Git, or don't understand any of the above, ask Greatexperiment on Discord.

Contributor & Developer Agreement:
If a contributor or developer creates either original[2] assets, code, or localization for 'Road to 56' and that work is published,[1] 'Road to 56' retains the right to use that material even if said contributor or developer no longer wishes to be or have said work affiliated with 'Road to 56' under opensource development principles.
Once said assets, code, or localization is published,[1] the contributor or developer cannot invoke Hearts of Iron 4 Modding Community guidelines as a basis for removal of work.
The above stipulations do not apply to code or assets that have been made for other Hearts of Iron 4 Modifications, other forms of media, or work that derives from copyrighted material as defined by either United States or European Union law that is included in 'Road to 56.'[3]
The contributor or developer may ask to withdraw work if said work isn't published[1] yet. 
To reiterate: 'Road to 56' retains the right to use all original contributor and developer work made for 'Road to 56.' Even if said contributor and developer wishes to be no longer affiliated with Road to 56 and asks for removal of assets, code, or localization made by them. Such requests are considered meritless under this agreement.
If you want to discuss particulars of this agreement, contact either Greatexperiment, Thinking_Waffle, SpicyAlfredo, or Abbus on Discord.
