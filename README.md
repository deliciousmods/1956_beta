Road to 56 Beta Build

This is the Readme guide for using Github with Road to 56.

Sign up with Github if you haven't already, and request membership / team assignment from Greatexperiment via Discord.
Download the desktop client from Github.
In the program, File -> Clone -> URL -> deliciousmods/1956_beta.
Set the local directory as your documents > Paradox Interactive > Hearts of Iron IV > mod folder.
Clone the project and download.
Be sure to create a .mod file or use the one included in the 1956_beta folder.
Create a personal branch of the mod via branch -> new branch in the client.
Be sure to periodically go to 'branch -> Update from beta-edits' to keep your files up to date.
All edits you do will automatically display in the client. If you are sure of your changes, put your handle in the summary box and a summary of your work in the description section.
Lastly, use the push button in the client to add your files to your branch.
When you are completely done you must request that your work be reviewed and added to the main mod. You do this via branch -> create pull request. Once accepted, your work will be in the mod.
Add your changes to the patch notes on the wiki.
Also, be sure to check our wiki for all the standards we use. The file structure of 56 is not the same as vanilla and we have some unusual naming conventions. If you don't follow these then there will be serious bugs and errors. Remember, only you can stop forest fires!

If for some reason you need greater access rights to the Git, or don't understand any of the above, ask Greatexperiment on Discord.
