#There's a limit to how many events can fit in a namespace.  To play it safe, I'm working with around 100.
#These events are for various leaders and personalities, so have a gameplay impact (so not just flavour).
#The idea is to do a bunch down the track, but this first one is a one-off because I just read Gilbertson's
#biography, and he was a legend and so get's a run.
