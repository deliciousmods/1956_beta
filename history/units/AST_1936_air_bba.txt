			#[6 Bristol Bulldog]In February 1930, eight single-seat Bristol Bulldog fighter aircraft arrived in Australia. Fighter Squadron was dissolved in December 1935 when its six surviving Bulldogs were re-designated as fighter-bombers and transferred from Point Cook to nearby RAAF Laverton
			#[18 Hawker Demons]In August 1934 the UK Government announced that the contracted delivery dates of the aircraft could not be met because Hawker production was geared solely to meet RAF requirements. A revised delivery date of late 1935 or early 1936 was offered but could not be guaranteed until the full RAF order was completed.  However, following strong pressure from the Australian Government, sweetened with a promise of follow-on orders, the 18 RAAF aircraft were delivered by Hawker in late 1934, tested in January 1935 and belatedly delivered in April – May 1935.  The aircraft were issued to No 1 and No 3 Squadrons with Serials A1-1 thru A1-18.
			#[36 Hawker Demons][Recived in Oct-Dec 1936]On 31 January 1935 the Minister of Defence announced that 18 additional Demons Serials A1-19 thru A1-36 would be purchased for 126,000 pounds Sterling, including the requisite extra engines, spares and specialist equipment. On 2 July 1935 a further 18 Demons Serials A1-37 to A1-54 were ordered bringing the total order to 54 Mk.I Demons. The additional 36 aircraft were modified for Army Co-operation with a prone bomb aimer’s position for the gunner in the lower fuselage and the fitment of bomb carriers.  The aircraft were also fitted with the 600hp RR Kestrel V DR engine and all 36 were delivered to Australia in 1936.
