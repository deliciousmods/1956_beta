 mexico.1.title:0 "General Cedillo Revolts"
 mexico.1.desc:0 "For some time, the generals and governors have seen their personal power dissipate as the central government becomes better at keeping the unruly caudillos in check. Mexico's history of rebellions by regional warlords seemed to be dying out. Unfortunately, we failed to act against General Cedillo of San Luis Potosi, and he has retained the services of enough pardoned rebels and ruthless bandits to try to overthrow the central government, depose [Root.GetLeader], and prevent any more power slipping through his fingers."

 mexico.2.title:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Oil Nationalized"
 mexico.2.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has been stirring up populist nonsense aimed against our economic interests in Mexico, and now the [From.GetRulingPartyLong] has passed legislation to nationalize the assets of Royal Dutch Shell, Standard Oil of California, and many other international oil firms! Although their Constitution allows this action, international justice demands compensation for the losses suffered by the firms. The oil barons are demanding we act."

 mexico.3.title:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Embargo"
 mexico.3.desc:0 "In response to our nationalization of their oil concessions, [From.GetLeader] has decided to accept the demands of the oil companies and has placed an embargo on our country. [From.GetNameDef] will no longer buy or sell resources with us. We should consider either compensating the oil firms, or abandoning the international status quo and seeking our fortunes with the enemies of liberal capitalism."
 mexico.3.a:0 "The Mexican people will not stand for this!"
 mexico.4.title:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Compensation"
 mexico.4.desc:0 "The government of [From.GetLeader] has agreed to demands from Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil of California for compensation in exchange for the losses sustained by the firms during nationalization of the oil fields. [From.GetNameDef] will not give back any oil concessions, but our national prestige and financial interests are at least sated."

 mexico.12.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has requested that [Root.GetNameDef] sell the small territory of British Honduras, sometimes called Belize. The Spanish empire claimed the region but never settled it, so Mexico has little real claim to the territory. However, we could sell the territory to our Mexican friends as a gesture of good faith."
 mexico.12.a:0 "[Root.GetLeader] accepts the proposal."
 mexico.12.b:0 "That territory is useful as a naval base."
 mexico.13.title:0 "Britain Cedes Belize"
 mexico.13.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has agreed to turn over control of the former colony of British Honduras to us as a gesture of good faith. The state is small, undeveloped and lacks natural resources other than lumber, but this shows Mexico's improved standing on the international stage."

 mexico.14.title:0 "Britain Declines Sale of Belize"
 mexico.14.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has refused to sell the colony of British Honduras to us. Citing its usefulness as a naval base, the [From.GetAdjective] government states its preference to retain the colony. Most inhabitants are English speakers so the refusal is understandable, if disappointing."

 mexico.15.title:0 "Archbishop Pascual Díaz Passes Away"
 mexico.15.desc:0 "The Most Reverend Pascual Díaz y Barreto, Archbishop of Mexico City, has passed away today due to colitis. He was 59. His legacy is one of hardline opposition to the socialist policies of the government, together with attempts at compromise towards the end of the Cristero War.\n\nHis successor is Luis María Martínez, a social reformer and personal friend of President Cárdenas. The successor was probably selected by the Pope to ensure continued peace between Church and government in Mexico."

 mexico.16.title:0 "Oil Worker Strike"
 mexico.16.desc:0 "The oil workers unionized in 1935 with the blessing of President Cárdenas, creating the Sindicato Único de Trabajadores Petroleros. They immediately began trying to negotiate higher wages and better working conditions, but were rebuffed by the powerful international oil firms like Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil of California. The matter passed to an arbitration committee and eventually went to the courts, with the burning question being whether the oil firms could afford the higher wages.\n\nAccording to recent investigations, the Mexican subsidiaries make even more profit than oil companies in the United States, but still refuse to come to an agreement with the workers. It seems they have the backing of powerful regional strongmen and see themselves as being above the law."

 mexico.18.title:0 "Election Campaign Begins"
 mexico.18.desc:0 "The election campaign for the next President is due to begin in the next few days. The 1933 constitutional reform was introduced in response to anger at the idea of Calles becoming president for a second term, and after the outright assassination of Calles' predecessor, Álvaro Obregón, who sought such a second term. This reform prevents an elected official serving twice, even if he was only an interim or provisional caretaker. This helps prevent a repeat of the Porfiriato, which saw dictator Porfirio Díaz serve seven terms in a thirty year period and inspired the 1910 Mexican Revolution, plunging the country into a decade of civil strife.\n\nThis law has the benefit of making patronage networks outside the party more difficult to sustain, but also prevents officials being directly accountable to electors, as they will move to a different tier of government after their term, making them reliant on patronage within the party."
 mexico.18.a:0 "This constitutional reform is essential for the stability of the country."

He claims his support was greater and that [Root.GetLeader] only won thanks to manipulating the outcome. While this might be true, Juan Andreu is certainly acting like a sore loser. He has gone into self-imposed exile in America and is trying to organize a coup attempt against the [Root.GetRulingPartyLong]. Remaining on good terms with America would be prudent."

 mexico.21.title:0 "Mexico Extradites Trotsky"
 mexico.21.desc:0 "Though promised asylum by the Mexican government a few months ago, upon his arrival in the country Leon Trotsky found himself arrested by state security of the [From.GetRulingPartyLong] and immediately embarked back to the Soviet Union to face trial for his many crimes against the revolutionary state. [From.GetLeader] has also expressed his hope that Mexico and the Soviet Union can enjoy closer relations in the future."

This attack on neutral vessels is an act of war. We would be within our rights to attack German vessels we encounter at sea.\n\nWe should also consider joining the American faction who are fighting the Germans. This would put the Yanquis in our debt and show the world that Mexico is an international player."

 mexico.26.title:0 "Mexico Joins the [From.GetFactionName]"
 mexico.26.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has welcomed the Mexican President's offer of support in the war against Germany. German wolfpacks recently sank the neutral Mexican oil tankers 'Potrero del Llano' and 'Faja de Oro', an act of war resulting in the loss of civilian life, and the Mexican government has stated its desire to see German u-boat activity in the Caribbean ended once and for all.\n\nThe Mexican government has sought greater recognition from the world powers for some time, and they believe that lending support to America and the [From.GetFactionName] will prove they are an international player."

With the government renewing its attacks on the Church, the embattled Catholic parties and social movements are launching an armed rebellion to seize control of Mexico. Cristero militias are reforming after a decade of inactivity, supplemented by defectors from the federal military. They have taken over several rural states and are using these as a base from which to operate.\n\nThe first Cristiada ended with a settlement negotiated between senior Revolutionary and Church officials thanks to intermediation by the American government, but it looks likely that this violence will end only with the complete destruction of one of the belligerents."

A constitutional crisis has now arisen as Mrs. Simpson is not only divorced from her previous husband, but in point of fact still married to her current husband, presently pursuing a second divorce. General outrage has ensued on the grounds that, as King, and being the head of the Church of England, Edward cannot marry a divorcée.\n\nThe King, however, has made it abundantly clear that he is very much in love with Mrs. Simpson, and intends to marry her regardless of the opinions of his governments or his subjects. As such, only three options remain open to him.\n\nThe British government and the governments of the Dominions have already stated that any alternative to abdication would be unacceptable, and repercussions of trying to force through a marriage, even an attempted compromise, would likely be dire, not only for Britain itself, but also for its ties to the Commonwealth. As the King's closest advisers continue their attempts to convince him, the public awaits with bated breath the resolution of this conflict between the King and his cabinet."

Based on recent events we can determine the King does not care at all for domestic public opinion, and if this is the nature of his relationship with the British people, of all things, then the situation can only become worse for his subjects in the Commonwealth.
