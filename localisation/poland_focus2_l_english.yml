 poland.109.t:0 "The Invention of the Land Mine Detector"
 poland.109.d:0 "In the interwar years, the Department of Artillery under the Polish Ministry of National Defence ordered the development of a device that could detect dud artillery shells on military training grounds. The AVA Radio Company completed the design of such a device, but it never entered into production due to the September Invasion. The Polish Army in Exile in France later reinvisioned the device as a mine detector. The final version was created by Polish Lieutenant Józef Kosacki who donated the blueprint to the British Army. The newly developed man-portable land mine detector was first used in the Battle of El Alamein where 500 detectors helped clear the way for the advance of the British Eighth Army. Over the course of the war, more than 100,000 units would be produced, and the same model would remain in service until the 1991 Gulf War."
