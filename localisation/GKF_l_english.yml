 DEN_Industrial_focus_desc:0 "We need to expand our industrial capacity. Jutland should have enough space for a few more factories, and we might learn a thing or two about efficiency while we build them."

 DEN_Industrial_Focus_Sjaelland_desc:0 "In the event of a German invasion, we may be forced to retreat to our two islands, Fyn and Sjaelland. Building factories here will make sure that they do not fall into German hands, even though the islands lack the same amount of space as Jutland has."
 DEN_Industrial_Focus_Sjaelland_short_desc:0 "Factories in Sjaelland"
 DEN_Industrial_Focus_Jutland:0 "Industry in Jutland"
 DEN_Industrial_Focus_Jutland_desc:0 "We need even more factories, and Sjaelland will not fit as many as Jutland will. Sure, it may be harder to defend, but we need the added industrial capacity!"

 DEN_Fortify_Jutland:0 "Fortifications at the German Border"
 DEN_Fortify_Jutland_desc:0 "Now that we have an increased amount of industry in Jutland, the Germans can easily reach it, should they invade us. We need to fortify the German border to be able to resist a German push into Jutland."

 DEN_Fortify_Sjaelland:0 "Forts on the Danish Isles"
 DEN_Fortify_Sjaelland_desc:0 "It is hopeless to defend Jutland against the numerically superiour German forces. Sjaelland and Funen, on the other hand, might stand a chance. If we build coastal forts, we might be able to stop the Germans from invading our main islands, should they take Jutland."
 DEN_Fortify_Sjaelland_short_desc:0 "§Fortifications in Sjaelland§"
 DEN_AA_Jutland:0 "Jutland Anti-Air Effort"
 DEN_AA_Jutland_desc:0 "We can build all the forts we want, but even the biggest of forts will not withstand heavy bombing from the air. If we up our anti-air defences, we stand a better chance. It will also reduce the effect of strategic bombing on our factories."
 DEN_AA_Jutland_short_desc:0 "Build AA in Jutland"
 DEN_AA_Sjaelland:0 "Sjaelland Anti-Air Effort"
 DEN_AA_Sjaelland_desc:0 "Now that we have concentrated parts of our industry in Sjaelland, we should prepare ourselves for an eventual bombing campaign. If we build heavy AA emplacements all around Copenhagen, we can better withstand a German threat to bomb our capital. It has the added benefit of giving our people a sense of security."
 DEN_AA_Sjaelland_short_desc:0 "Build AA in Sjaelland"
 DEN_Danish_Steel:0 "Found The Danish Steel Rolling Mill"
 DEN_Danish_Steel_desc:0 "The Danish Steel Rolling Mill, in Danish 'Det Danske Stålvalseværk' was founded in Frederiksværk, a town in Sjaelland. This huge steel mill will deliver a big portion of the steel our country needs, and understandably, representatives from our dockyards, including A.P. Møller, are heavily investing in this plant."
 DEN_Danish_Steel_short_desc:0 "Found The Danish Steel Rolling Mill"
 DEN_Armament_Effort:0 "Expand our arms factories"
 DEN_Armament_Effort_desc:0 "If we need to prepare for war, we must build more factories which produce arms. We might also learn a thing or two about production efficiency while we are at it."

 DEN_Armament_Effort_2:0 "Arms Factory Expansion"
 DEN_Armament_Effort_2_desc:0 "Our generals say that we have lots of space for new arms factories in Sjaelland. There appear to be willing investors, too. Let us expand our military industrial capacity."
 DEN_Armament_Effort_2_short_desc:0 "Build more factories in Sjaelland"
 DEN_DISA:0 "Expand DISA"
 DEN_DISA_desc:0 "DISA, an arms manufacturer known in Danish as 'Dansk Industri Syndikat A/S', has existed for several decades and produces certain very successful weapons, such as the Madsen machinegun which even the Germans, Italians, Russians and the Japanese use. This company is clearly capable of innovation and production, expanding it will undoubtedly result in more military innovations."
 DEN_DISA_short_desc:0 "Expand the DISA"
 DEN_Naval_Effort:0 "Expand the Orlogsværft"
 DEN_Naval_Effort_desc:0 "If we intend to expand our production of vessels for the Royal Danish Navy, we must expand our shipbuilding facilities. The 400 year old shipyard in Copenhagen, known as the Orlogsværft, has been serving us faithfully and will continue to do so."
 DEN_Naval_Effort_short_desc:0 "Expand the Orlogsværft"
 DEN_Naval_Effort_2:0 "Expand Odense Staalskibsværft"
 DEN_Naval_Effort_2_desc:0 "Shipping magnate A.P. Møller owns a mediocre sized civilian shipyard near Odense. If we help him expand his shipyard, we could build some of our own ships there too."
 DEN_Naval_Effort_2_short_desc:0 "Build shipyards in Odense"
 DISA_idea:0 "Dansk Industri Syndikat"
 DISA_idea_desc:0 "The Danish Industry Syndicate was initially formed as the Danish Rifle Syndicate, to produce the immensely popular Madsen machinegun. We have expanded DISA with new factories and larger R&D divisions, giving us increased abilities in research and production of infantry weapons and support artillery."
 DEN_Staff:0 "Danish General Staff"
 DEN_Staff_desc:0 "We have expanded our general staff and made sure to select the most qualified candidates for promotions. This has paid off, as our army has been strenghtened and our ability to plan our moves in great detail increased."
 DEN_Infra:0 "Danish Autobahn"
 DEN_Infra_desc:0 "Our German neighbors have built a large highway which allows for quick transport of military equipment and soldiers. They call it the Reichsautobahn. Perhaps we could build a similar highway in Denmark?"
 DEN_Infra_short_desc:0 "Build infrastructure in Denmark"
 DEN_Gen_Staff:0 "Expand the General Staff"
 DEN_Gen_Staff_desc: "Just like the Germans, we have our own general staff, the Generalstab. If we are to expand our army, we should also expand our general staff and streamline our recruitment and promotion guidelines to ensure that the most qualified people are used in the best ways possible. This has the added benefit of allowing our generals to develop new doctrines much more quickly."
 DEN_Gen_Staff_short_desc:0 "Expand the Generalstab"
 DEN_SOK:0 "Create the SOK"
 DEN_SOK_desc:0 "The navy has long been neglected under the Social Democratic government of Thorval Stauning. This has recently changed, with the expansion of the shipyards in Odense and Copenhagen. To match our naval expansion, we must also expand our general staff for our navy. We should form Søværnets Operative Kommando, the SOK. This might help us develop more advanced naval doctrines as well."
 DEN_SOK_short_desc:0 "Create the SOK"
 DEN_Cruiser_Focus:0 "Cruiser Effort"
 DEN_Cruiser_Focus_desc:0 "If we are to defend our waters, we must build a sizable navy consisting of cruisers and destroyers."
 DEN_Cruiser_Focus_short_desc:0 "Focus on cruisers"
 DEN_Submarine_Focus:0 "Submarine Effort"
 DEN_Submarine_Focus_desc:0 "We have naval bases in the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. These bases can be used as staging bases for submarine wolfpacks. If we follow through on this idea and build a large submarine navy, it will act as a deterrent towards any nation that considers invading us."
 DEN_Submarine_Focus_short_desc:0 "Submarine Effort"
 DEN_Cruiser_Doctrine:0 "Develop Cruiser Doctrines"
 DEN_Cruiser_Doctrine_desc:0 "While we can certainly expand our naval capabilities, we will never be able to rival the major European naval powers in size. As such we must do everything we can to ensure that we are ahead of them when it comes to naval tactics."
 DEN_Cruiser_Doctrine_short_desc:0 "Develop Cruiser Doctrines"
 DEN_Sub_Doctrine:0 "Develop Submarine Doctrines"
 DEN_Sub_Doctrine_desc:0 "For our submarines to operate effectively, we must develop new ways for them to strike at the enemy. Perhaps if we study German efforts we can use them for our own gain."
 DEN_Sub_Doctrine_short_desc:0 "Develop Submarine Doctrines"
 DEN_License_Production:0 "Establish License Production"
 DEN_License_Production_desc:0 "Other nations are developing promising weapon designs. If we happen to be on good terms with a nearby major power, we might be able to arrange license production of one of their weapons. For this, we should build new factories too."
 DEN_License_Production_short_desc:0 "Establish License Production"
 DEN_Exerises:0 "Start National Exercises"
 DEN_Exerises_desc:0 "To prepare our army for war, we should conduct large scale wargames across the entire country. This has the added benefit of giving us some experience."
 DEN_Exerises_short_desc:0 "National Exercises"
 DEN_Army_Improv:0 "Army Improvement Effort"
 DEN_Army_Improv_desc:0 "It is time to start improving our army, and with it, the equipment we issue it. Let us begin by improving our larger guns, such as our artillery, AA and AT weapons. This will be a first step in that direction."
 DEN_Army_Improv_short_desc:0 "Army Improvement"

 DEN_Equipment_Effort_short_desc:0 "Equipment Effort"
 DEN_Mot_Effort:0 "Motorization Effort"
 DEN_Mot_Effort_desc:0 "If we are to commence any offensive operations, we should have a motorized army, if at least partially. The Swedes have the Scania, the Germans have the Opel Blitz, perhaps we could look into purchasing examles of those to speed up our own research."
 DEN_Mot_Effort_short_desc:0 "Motorization Effort"
 DEN_Mech_Effort:0 "Mechanization Effort"
 DEN_Mech_Effort_desc:0 "Our research so far has shown that a motorized army would be a great advantage to any offensive operation we might intend to do. We could develop vehicles with extra armor and better capabilities in terrain, and develop mechanized divisions."
 DEN_Mech_Effort_short_desc:0 "Mechanization Effort"
 DEN_Special_Forces:0 "Develop Special Forces"
 DEN_Special_Forces_desc:0 "Other nations are developing elite units such as marines and paratroopers. We could do the same. Such units do not require significant amounts of manpower nor do they use up a lot of industry compared to armored units. They might just be the perfect solution to some of our offensive problems."
 DEN_Special_Forces_short_desc:0 "Special Forces"
 DEN_Doctrine_Effort:0 "Doctrine Effort"

 DEN_Armor_Effort:0 "Armor Effort"
 DEN_Armor_Effort_desc:0 "Denmark is not capable of developing armored designs by itself, but our neighbors are fielding armor in larger numbers every day. Even the Swedes are producing tanks!

 DEN_Armor_Effort_short_desc:0 "Armor Effort"
 DEN_Destroyer_Focus:0 "Foreign Ship Designs"

 DEN_Foreign_Subs_short_desc:0 "Foreign Submarine Designs"
 DEN_Aviation_Effort:0 "Aviation Effort"

 DEN_Aviation_Doc_short_desc:0 "Develop Air Doctrines"
 DEN_Heavy_Air_Focus:0 "Heavy Aircraft Focus"
 DEN_Heavy_Air_Focus_desc:0 "Let us focus on heavy aircraft such as tactical bombers and strategic bombers. We will be able to rain death on our enemies from above, even if we cannot produce very many of them."

 DEN_Light_Air_Focus:0 "Light Air Focus"
 DEN_Light_Air_Focus_desc:0 "Our industrial capacity will most likely not be able to handle prodcution of heavy aircraft. We should instead focus on developing single-engine aircraft, to defend our airspace and give ground support for our troops. This is the path our generals favor."
 DEN_Light_Air_Focus_short_desc:0 "Light Air Focus"
 DEN_CAS_Focus:0 "CAS Focus"
 DEN_CAS_Focus_desc:0 "Close Air Support is vital to the success of our ground troops. We should develop new versions of our Close Air Support aircraft, so that we can assist our troops even better in combat."
 DEN_CAS_Focus_short_desc:0 "CAS Focus"
 DEN_Tac_Bomber_Focus:0 "Tactical Bomber Focus"
 DEN_Tac_Bomber_Focus_desc:0 "Tactical bombers are not as expensive to produce as strategic bombers, but can be used in the same role. They have the added benefit of being a multi-role craft, and as such can also strike enemy ground forces, albeit not as effectively as CAS aircraft."
 DEN_Tac_Bomber_Focus_short_desc:0 "Tactical Bomber Focus"
 DEN_CAS:0 "Army Aviation Focus"
 DEN_CAS_desc:0 "By putting a part of our airforce under the command of our army, we have increased the effectiveness of our ground support missions."
 DEN_CAS_short_desc:0 "Army Aviation Focus"
 DEN_Army_Aviation:0 "Army Aviation"
 DEN_Army_Aviation_desc:0 "We can integrate a part of our airforce into our army. More specifically, the CAS wings. If we do so, we can expect to see increased effectiveness when we use our aircraft for ground support."
