 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Spanish Republic is only five years old but has seen itself confronted with instability from both sides of the political spectrum. The failure of the Asturian uprising in 1934 left many marks on Spanish society, and the corruption of Alejandro Lerroux's government only made the population lose more trust in it, leading to a radicalisation of the population.\n\nOn the left is the Popular Front, united in their anti-fascism and their desire for a reform of the republic, while on the right, the CEDA is getting closer and closer to authoritarianism and corporatism and the Falange is becoming more and more threatening."

 SPR_spain.1.t:0 "The Reactionaries have been Crushed!"
 SPR_spain.1.desc:0 "After heroic efforts, the Spanish people helped by anti-fascist from all over the world have crushed the fascist Rebels and ensured the triumph of the Popular Front.

 SPR_spain.5.desc:0 "The Spanish Government, supported by Soviet support for its claims, has sent us an ultimatum, asking for the return of the Gibraltar Rock to Spain, at the risk of military action being taken in the event of refusal.\n\nThe neutrality shown by Great Britain during the civil war did not really help in recreating friendly relations between the United Kingdom and the new Spanish communist government, which had therefore moved closer to the Soviet Union and the comintern.\n\nGibraltar represents a lot in terms of military strategy, in fact, whoever controls the rock can control the entry and exit of ships through the Mediterranean, which would make it a crucial point in case of conflict with any Mediterranean power.\n\nBut despite all these advantages, are they worth it if it is to risk a war with Spain and the Soviet Union?"

The right is becoming more radical day by day with the CEDA seeing less and less well the democratic system and the Falangists continuing to gain in popularity, leading to confrontations with socialists, anarchists and communists often culminating in political assassinations."
