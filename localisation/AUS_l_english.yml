AUS_reinstate_the_habsburg_family_desc:0 "After the end of the Great War, the Habsburgs, the rightful rulers of Austria-Hungary, were stripped of all lands and titles and exiled. These steps were taken under duress; however, the only thing the Habsburgs ever did wrong to us was to lose the war in the first place. They have ever been loyal to us, and so we shall be loyal to them."

AUS_liechtenstein_treaty:0 "Liechtenstein Treaty"

AUS_ban_the_national_socialist_party_desc:0 "The Nazis are a political powerhouse here in Austria as well as in Germany. However, their message to Austria is not one that aligns with our interests. In fact, one might argue that it is treason. Shall we act accordingly?"

AUS_undermine_mussolini:0 "Undermine Mussolini"
AUS_undermine_mussolini_desc:0 "Not all of Italy is united under Mussolini's ideals, as much as he would like for that to be the case. A little political support from our own royalists may increase royalist support in Italy and oust the fascist regime."

AUS_assassination_of_horthy_desc:0 "'King Horthy', as he has pretentiously called himself, was once a mere military officer. He now pretends to the throne of Hungary, a claim which is essentially laughable. He has power, however, in spite of this.

 news.1114.t:0 "Austria-Hungary has reformed"
 news.1114.d:0 "Despite being apart for over 19 years, Austria and Hungary have decided to rejoin the union they once shared, both countries are now one, both politically and militarily."
 news.1114.a:0 "Will we see the old empire anew?"
 
 austria.1111.t:0 "The Austrian Compromise"
 austria.1111.d:0 "The Austrian government has, obviously, heard word of our campaign for Anschluss of our two great nations, and has offered a compromise - support in any forthcoming war, for autonomy in the meantime."
 austria.1111.a:0 "They will be valuable as an autonomous ally."
 austria.1111.b:0 "Must we remind them of the importance of true unity?"
 
 austria.1112.t:0 "Germany has accepted our proposal"
 austria.1112.d:0 "Germany's government has accepted our alternate offer, granting us our freedom as a nation. Hail to our alliance!"
 austria.1112.a:0 "To the future of the Central Powers!"
 
 austria.1113.t:0 "Germany has denied our proposal"
 austria.1113.d:0 "The Nazis have decided that the unification of the Central Powers is the only way forward, and it seems that we are not part of that plan. Anschluss will go forward."
 austria.1113.a:0 "This is a forboding possibility."
 
 austria.1114.t:0 "Reunification of Austria-Hungary"
 austria.1114.d:0 "For a long time, the countries of Austria and Hungary were united under a common emperor. Austria's government has approached us, and requests that we assist in reinstating this arrangement."
 austria.1114.a:0 "Of course! We will regain what we have lost together!"
 austria.1114.b:0 "Hungary will protect its autonomy, from Germans and Austrians alike."
 
 austria.1115.t:0 "Hungary has accepted reunification"
 austria.1115.d:0 "Hungary has accepted its place in our new, shared empire. Now, we look onwards, to the future of Austria-Hungary!"
 austria.1115.a:0 "Onwards!"
 
 austria.1116.t:0 "Hungary has denied reunification"
 austria.1116.d:0 "It seems that the Hungarians are protective of their autonomy. Our offer has been respectfully declined, raising doubts as to their true motives."
 austria.1116.a:0 "Hm..."
 
 austria.1117.t:0 "Austria-Hungary demands Transylvania"
 austria.1117.d:0 "Austria-Hungary has been making statements amongst its own people and ours about the importance of Transylvania to the Hungarian people. If we are to avoid war, it has come to the breakpoint - do we cede Transylvania?"
 austria.1117.a:0 "Transylvania is rightfully ours!"
 austria.1117.b:0 "If we go to war, they will just take everything."
 
 austria.1118.t:0 "Romania has yielded"
 austria.1118.d:0 "The Romanians have displayed unusual wisdom in ceding Transylvania as demanded. The local governmental infrastructure is already being transferred to our control, and we can move troops in as needed."
 austria.1118.a:0 "Perfect."
 
 austria.1119.t:0 "Romania has denied us"
 austria.1119.d:0 "It seems the upstart Romanians have forgotten to whom Transylvania belongs. War with them is absolutely justified; but is it the time?"
 austria.1119.a:0 "The fools. Mobilise the troops."
 austria.1119.b:0 "War is inopportune right now. Another time."
 
 austria.1122.t:0 "Transylvania is ours"
 austria.1122.d:0 "Transylvania is ours, and we have the opportunity to force an advantageous peace to keep the land we have demanded. This war has already claimed too many lives; should we force a peace deal?"
 austria.1122.a:0 "This war is pointless now."
 austria.1122.b:0 "Push to Bucharest!"
 
 austria.1124.t:0 "The Romanian Question"
 austria.1124.d:0 "The Romanian majority in Transylvania has, despite being largely peaceful, kept up a stiff political resistance to Hungarian rule. This is unacceptable. If the majority won't accept their rule, we will make them a minority."
 austria.1124.a:0 "Remove them."
 austria.1124.b:0 "Perhaps a bridge too far."
 
 austria.1125.t:0 "Austria demands Slovenia"
 austria.1125.d:0 "The Austrian government has been applying political pressure of late for the region of Slovenia. War with them may be costly, but can we afford to cede land so easily?"
 austria.1125.a:0 "If it spares the lives of our people, yes."
 austria.1125.b:0 "Never! Yugoslavia will defend its own!"
 
 austria.1126.t:0 "Yugoslavia cedes Slovenia"
 austria.1126.d:0 "The Yugoslavians have wisely ceded the land we have demanded, granting our troops complete access, as well as control of any and all facilities. Our plans proceed as required."
 austria.1126.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1127.t:0 "Yugoslavia refused our demands"
 austria.1127.d:0 "The upstart false-nation of Yugoslavia seems to want to fight back against us. What other explanation could we have for so rude a refusal? We will have to take back what is ours."
 austria.1127.a:0 "Then it seems we have no choice."
 
 austria.1128.t:0 "Austria demands former territories"
 austria.1128.d:0 "Austrian aggressions have come to a head, and they now demand the northern territories of Yugoslavia for their own purposes. They are an intimidating power - but should we concede?"
 austria.1128.a:0 "We will defend our own land!"
 austria.1128.b:0 "We cannot face a war with Austria."
 
 austria.1129.t:0 "Yugoslavia refuses our demands"
 austria.1129.d:0 "The pretender state of Yugoslavia has denied us the land we have every right to. We can go to war at this very moment, but is it the opportune moment?"
 austria.1129.a:0 "We will take what we need."
 austria.1129.b:0 "Now is not the time."
 
 austria.1130.t:0 "Yugoslavia cedes the Northern Balkans"
 austria.1130.d:0 "Yugoslavia recognizes that they cannot face a war with our superior military, and has ceded their northern lands to us. We are already installing our own political agents."
 austria.1130.a:0 "Just as planned."
 
 austria.1131.t:0 "Our goals have been met"
 austria.1131.d:0 "We have taken all the ground we demanded from Yugoslavia, and now their desperate defensive forces are grasping at straws for any way out - including a ceasefire. We can enforce this now, but is it the best option?"
 austria.1131.a:0 "Now is not the time for overlong wars."
 austria.1131.b:0 "We can and will take all they have!"
 
 austria.1132.t:0 "Remilitarization of Serbia"
 austria.1132.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Yugoslavian war, our armies have gained tactical access to deeper regions of Serbia. Onwards!"
 austria.1132.a:0 "Just as planned!"
 
 austria.1133.t:0 "Austria requests Slovakia"
 austria.1133.d:0 "The Austrian government has made a request that the occupied region of Slovakia is transferred to their control, in light of its ancestral heritage as Austro-Hungarian land."
 austria.1133.a:0 "This seems reasonable."
 austria.1133.b:0 "It was Austrian, and is now German."
 
 austria.1138.t:0 "Germany has given us Slovakia"
 austria.1138.d:0 "The German government has come to the consensus that we are deserving of a stake in the Slovakian region. They have transferred control of all facilities to us and we are free to make use of the land in any way necessary."
 austria.1138.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1139.t:0 "Germany has withheld Slovakia"
 austria.1139.d:0 "Germany has denied our request for the Slovakian region. A sad state of affairs, but surely we will have our day in time."
 austria.1139.a:0 "An unfortunate setback."
 
 austria.1140.t:0 "Austria requests Krakow"
 austria.1140.d:0 "Austria has requested the Polish region of Krakow, which has long been contested between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Poland. Their claim is just - but will we grant it?"
 austria.1140.a:0 "Of course."
 austria.1140.b:0 "This does not suit our needs."
 
 austria.1141.t:0 "Germany has given us Krakow"
 austria.1141.d:0 "Germany has ceded access to the region of Krakow, granting us access to another ancient center of Austro-Hungarian heritage."
 austria.1141.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1142.t:0 "Germany has withheld Krakow"
 austria.1142.d:0 "Germany has denied us Krakow, retaining access of the city and denying us ancient Austro-Hungarian land. A questionable decision, for sure."
 austria.1142.a:0 "Questionable, but implacable."
 
 austria.1143.t:0 "Dalmatia for South Tyrol"
 austria.1143.d:0 "The political machinations of Italy gained us a part of Tyrol after the Great War. The Austrians intend to reclaim the territory in time - and we intend to claim Dalmatia. Perhaps an agreement can be reached...?"
 austria.1143.a:0 "It seems to be necessary."
 austria.1143.b:0 "We will cede them nothing!"
 
 austria.1144.t:0 "Italy has agreed to our deal"
 austria.1144.d:0 "The Italians have accepted our offer, agreeing to move their troops out of Dalmatia as we move ours out of Tyrol. The exchange is effective immediately."
 austria.1144.a:0 "Just as planned."
 
 austria.1145.t:0 "Italy has refused our deal"
 austria.1145.d:0 "The Italians have decided that their claim over the Italian majority in Dalmatia is worth more than their dubious claim to the rest of Tyrol. They have refused our offer."
 austria.1145.a:0 "Perhaps for the best."
 
 austria.1146.t:0 "Austria demands the Istrian Peninsula"
 austria.1146.d:0 "The Austrians have demanded the Istrian peninsula, a stronghold of Austro-Hungarian naval superiority since before the Great War. Denying them could mean consequences."
 austria.1146.a:0 "They are too dangerous a power to deny."
 austria.1146.b:0 "We can deal with consequences."
 
 austria.1147.t:0 "Italy has ceded Istria"
 austria.1147.d:0 "Italy has ceded the old naval stronghold of Istria to us, effective immediately. Our troops are free to reclaim it."
 austria.1147.a:0 "Perfect!"
 
 austria.1148.t:0 "Italy has refused our demands"
 austria.1148.d:0 "The Italians have foolishly stood up to us. Perhaps it is time we show the upstarts that beating us once does not guarantee victory again."
 austria.1148.a:0 "Are they prepared for war?"
 
 austria.1149.t:0 "Austrian invitation"
 austria.1149.d:0 "The Austrian government has extended an invitation to a military alliance headed by their own empire. A powerful ally to have - but do we need their help?"
 austria.1149.a:0 "Any help in these unstable times is welcome."
 austria.1149.b:0 "We can forge our own way."
 
 austria.1150.t:0 "Austrian Ultimatum"
 austria.1150.d:0 "Austria has delivered an ultimatum to us - to come under the dominion of the Österreich Imperium, or to be brought under Austrian dominion forcefully. We are placed in a difficult position."
 austria.1150.a:0 "We will protect our citizens' way of life!"
 austria.1150.b:0 "It seems we must accept Austrian leadership."
 
 austria.1151.t:0 "Greece has refused our ultimatum"
 austria.1151.d:0 "The impudent Greeks have delivered a stinging slap to the face, denying our offer of political and military protection. Such an overt gesture is absolutely an act of war!"
 austria.1151.a:0 "And we will treat it as such!"
 
 austria.1152.t:0 "Greece has succumbed to our ultimatum"
 austria.1152.d:0 "Greece has wisely accepted our offer of protection in these dark and troubled times. Their government has changed hands with minimal fuss to our control and they will operate as part of our coalition."
 austria.1152.a:0 "The wiser choice to make."
 
 austria.1153.t:0 "Austrian invitation"
 austria.1153.d:0 "Our old allies, the Austrians, have extended an arm in friendship, offering a resurrection of the old Central Powers. Perhaps it is time to rejoin with our old Ottoman allies?"
 austria.1153.a:0 "If there is any time, it is now."
 austria.1153.b:0 "We must consider our allies more carefully, if a war is coming."
 
 austria.1154.t:0 "Turkey has agree to join us"
 austria.1154.d:0 "Turkey has accepted our offer of alliance, and stands with us in any future conflict. The Ottomans have not forgotten their friends!"
 austria.1154.a:0 "And neither have we."
 
 austria.1155.t:0 "Turkey has refused to join us"
 austria.1155.d:0 "Turkey, it seems, has forgotten how loyally we stood by each other in the Great War. They have denied our alliance, and will go their own way."
 austria.1155.a:0 "A troubling concept."
 
 austria.1156.t:0 "We have beaten back the Soviets"
 austria.1156.d:0 "The Ukranian uprising has been going well, relatively, speaking, and yet the Soviet bear is still a worrying presence above us. We can keep pushing if we believe we can take more ground - or we can deliver a peace deal."
 austria.1156.a:0 "We will offer peace - with conditions."
 austria.1156.b:0 "The Soviets cannot be allowed to continue!"
 
 austria.1157.t:0 "The Ukrainian Armistice"
 austria.1157.d:0 "The Austrians have delivered a peace deal. Considering how the war has been going, the terms are generous - an immediate ceasefire, in exchange for freedom for the Russian Ukraine. Should we accept?"
 austria.1157.a:0 "It seems necessary."
 austria.1157.b:0 "Not until the last man is dead!"
 
 austria.1158.t:0 "The Soviets have conceded"
 austria.1158.d:0 "The Soviets have accepted a ceasefire. The Ukraine is in the hands of the Ukrainians, and the Ukranians are very grateful to us. A major victory."
 austria.1158.a:0 "And another step in our plans."
 
 austria.1159.t:0 "The Soviets have refused"
 austria.1159.d:0 "The Soviets have decided that their interests are better served by a long, grinding war. Evidence of the true Soviet view of the value of the worker, perhaps?"
 austria.1159.a:0 "For the sake of our own, we will end this quickly."
 
 austria.1160.t:0 "We have achieved our goals"
 austria.1160.d:0 "The Ukranian uprising has gone well, and a free Ukranian state is now a possibility. We can deliver a peace deal to the Soviets - peace, for Ukranian freedom. A more reasonable offer, we could not make."
 austria.1160.a:0 "Anything to bring democracy to the Ukraine."
 austria.1160.b:0 "The Soviets cannot be trusted to remain peaceful."

As of now, no connection between him and any organized political groups could be established, but the fact that he committed suicide via hidden cyanide pills upon capture hint towards outside assistance.\n\nQuite a few influential communist leaders openly celebrated the death of Schushnigg. Celebratory marches followed by violent riots broke out in Vienna, and it has become apparent that political violence isn't off limits anymore. Foreign observers fear a rapid escalation leading to something far worse, as Austria is now left without a steadfast anti-communist figure in the highest office."

 AUS_support_weapons:0 "Schwarlose M. 7"
 AUS_support_weapons_desc:0 "The Maschinengewehr (Schwarzlose) M. 7, also known as the Schwarzlose MG, is a medium machine-gun, used as a standard issue firearm in the Austro-Hungarian Army throughout World War I. It was utilized by the Dutch, Greek and Hungarian armies during World War II. It was routinely issued to Italian colonial troops, alongside the Mannlicher M1895 rifle."
 AUS_support_weapons2:0 "MG 34"
 AUS_support_weapons2_desc:0 "The versatile MG 34 was arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time of its deployment. Its combination of exceptional mobility – being light enough to be carried by one man – and high rate of fire (of up to 900 rounds per minute) was unmatched."
 AUS_support_weapons3:0 "MG 42"
 AUS_support_weapons3_desc:0 "Intended to replace the earlier MG 34, the MG 42 has a proven record of reliability, durability, simplicity, and ease of operation, but is most notable for its ability to produce a high volume of suppressive fire. The MG 42 had one of the highest average cyclic rates of any single-barreled man-portable machine gun: between 1,200 and 1,500 rpm, resulting in a distinctive muzzle report compared to the sound of a power saw or tearing linoleum."
 AUS_support_weapons4:0 "MG 45"
 AUS_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The MG 45 differed from the MG 42 in that it did not completely lock its breech before firing, increasing its rate of fire and simplifying its construction. In 1945, the material shortages of the Third Reich led to the development of a newer version of the MG 42, the MG 45 (or MG 42V). The tested MG 45/42V fired 120,000 rounds in succession at a rate of fire around 1,350 rounds per minute."
