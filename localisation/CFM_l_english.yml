 cityfall.1.d:0 "Victorious American soldiers march through the streets of London after fierce fighting for most of the day. Although most of the cities monuments were preserved in the fighting, the Tower Bridge was destroyed after retreating British troops attempted to break out over the Thames across the bridge, American airstrikes destroying the middle of the bridge before they could reach the other side.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes have now replaced the Union Jack and the president is scheduled to give a speech where once was the Buckingham Palace. A empire wanes, while another rises."

 cityfall.2.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.2.d:0 "In the mind of all good Britons everywhere, the worst-case scenario has befallen the great nation. The defenders of London have fought nearly to a man against the oncoming French legions, but after bitter fighting and the defeat of brave Home Guard units, London has fallen. Even now, gunfire can still be heard across the city, as brave Londoners continue to resist the armies of their greatest nemesis.\n\nDespite the attempts of the British army and the people of London, however, French forces control enough of the streets that nobody can truly defy French control over the city. The tricolor is now flying above the ruins of the Buckingham Palace, and for the first time in a millennium, French is now the lingua franca of London."
 cityfall.2.a:0 "History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes."

 cityfall.3.d:0 "In a move that has shocked the many people's of the world, Polish soldiers have taken London. After a daring raid by Polish cavalry, which destroyed most of the local defender's ammunition stores, Polish troops proceeded to use the London metro and old sewer systems to sneak behind enemy lines. Before the defenders had time to counterattack, multiple Polish squadrons had already appeared within the city limits and large portions of the garrison were surrendering within only a few hours.\n\nSome of the defenders have managed to store away some ammo and now resist the Polish invaders in certain areas, gunshots still being heard near the Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London, with Polish crack units are already dealing with the remaining resistance."
 cityfall.3.a:0 "Can anybody doubt the power of Poland now?"
 cityfall.3.b:0 "Nobody can deny the power of Poland now!"
 cityfall.3.c:0 "Damned Poles!"
 cityfall.4.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.4.d:0 "As the Rising Sun rises ever higher, another sun may finally set in the British Isles. The Hinomaru already flies from every abbey and tower across London, now renamed Daishori, and Japanese officials have already established a transitional administration to handle their new conquest.\nAlready, dissenters have been gathered up and driven off in the middle of the night, and the British units who have surrendered have begun a march to new camps being built for them in the countryside. Several local British leaders have been offered seppuku, to atone for their failure and due to the possibility of resistance rallying around them, the offer was not voluntary. The Buckingham Palace has already been chosen for renovations to become one the Emperor's new seasonal residences, that is, after the war is over."
 cityfall.4.a:0 "The east has come west, it seems."
 cityfall.4.b:0 "Only one sun shall never set."
 cityfall.4.c:0 "They think they've won, but we shall return!"
 cityfall.5.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.5.d:0 "To the backdrop of a burning London, Spanish troops now raise the red and gold flag of Spain over the city. The harbor burns in a cruel reversal of the burning of the Spanish armada back in 1588. The fighting was hard fought across the city, Spanish troops facing stiff resistance street by street, but in the end the Spanish invaders have finally broken the last of the British lines and now only face sparse resistance around the city's outer limits.\n\n[SPR.GetLeader] himself has been flown out to London in his personal plane and will be giving a speech to the assorted Spanish soldiers on their gallantry within the hour, and afterwards, he'll address to the people of London on what is to be expected for them in the coming days."
 cityfall.5.a:0 "The tides of history seem to have turned."
 cityfall.5.b:0 "A mistake finally corrected."
 cityfall.5.c:0 "The battle for London may be over, but the war for Britain is not lost yet!"
 cityfall.6.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.6.d:0 "Earlier today, the fall of the Reich Chancelllery marked the end of an epic battle through the war-torn streets of Berlin. Japanese soldiers have raised the Hinomaru over the ruined building, the corpses of its defenders littering the building and streets around it, and twice as many Japanese soldiers having perished.\n\nThe battle for the Reichstag was comparatively short after a German plane lost control and slammed into the building, its fuel tanks tearing apart most of the heavily fortified defenses in it. Now with the Reich Chancellery gone, only a handful of German units remain bunkered down in the Gendarmenmarkt Konzerthaus, but Japanese troops have already breached into the outer rooms of the building."
 cityfall.6.a:0 "So much of a Thousand-Year Reich."
 cityfall.6.b:0 "No eagle can match the might of the Rising Sun!"
 cityfall.6.c:0 "The yellow-skinned enemy shall be crushed, no matter the cost!"
 cityfall.7.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.7.d:0 "Although a fierce tank battle is still happening across the Ackerstraße, in the rest of the city, German soldiers have begun either retreating or making their last stand in face of the victorious Spanish troops.\n\nThe battle, which has seen much of the old city destroyed and left most of the city's road unusable, was won after a concentrated effort by Spanish forces to take on the U-Bahn, with the German defender being taken by surprise by the Spanish push underground.\n\nNow with the last of the organized defenses stamped out, it seems that Germany now stands in its last legs."
 cityfall.7.a:0 "Who could have foreseen this?"
 cityfall.7.b:0 "Plus ultra!"
 cityfall.7.c:0 "We will not surrender until our last soldier lies death!"
 cityfall.8.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.8.d:0 "Yugoslavian authorities already plan for a grand ceremony down the Kurfürstendamm, with the end of the fighting in the city earlier today. German forces held out for hours on end, bunkering down in any fortifiable building they could find, one of them being the Zoo flak tower. But in the end it didn't matter, and the flag of Yugoslavia already can be seen hanging from various surviving landmarks across the city.\n\nWhat this means for the Reich remains to be seen, but most foresee the war ending in a victory for Yugoslavia."
 cityfall.8.a:0 "On the German back now lies a Slavic yoke."
 cityfall.8.b:0 "A historic day for all the people of Yugoslavia!"

 cityfall.9.d:0 "After an explosive end to a day of fighting, the Czechoslovakian government announced that the country's Armed forces now decisive control over the capital city of Berlin.\n\nAfter a day of fighting across the entirety of the city, which unfortunately leveled many of its landmarks such as the Victory Column, resistance still remains heavily active underground, German militias and proper units still holding out. But Czech forces have keep on detonating the bulkheads under the Landwehr Canal, hoping to drown the last of the defenders who refuse to surrender."
 cityfall.9.a:0 "A thousand-year Reich, they said?"
 cityfall.9.b:0 "March on brothers, for only we will prevail!"
 cityfall.9.c:0 "We will never surrender, to the front lines!"
 cityfall.10.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.10.d:0 "Perhaps the final nail was struck into the coffin of the Reich today when Italian troops, weary yet unendingly determined in their attacks, finally managed to reach the roof of the Reichstag. The Italian tricolor was raised shortly after, and Italian troops have now begun the work of clearing the last redoubts of German resistance in the city.\n\nTrains of prisoners have already begun their travel through the rails to POW camps in the suburbs, and Italian soldiers have already began setting up soup-kitchens and outposts around the city to begin its long road to recovery."
 cityfall.10.a:0 "A revenge a millennium in the making."
 cityfall.10.b:0 "Veni, vidi, vici."
 cityfall.10.c:0 "Roma will never rule over Germania!"
 cityfall.11.t:0 "The Fall of Stockholm"
 cityfall.11.d:0 "Stockholm, the capital of the Swedish state, has fallen after heavy fighting for most of the day. The local Swedish forces had turned the ancient island of Gamla stan into a fortress and fought fiercely to hold the Germans out, but they were finally forced to withdraw after a massive artillery barrage laid waste on their lines.\n\nAlthough Swedish troops hoped to stall them further, demolition charges on the Vasabron bridge failed to detonate and the Germans managed to overwhelm the last of the defenders shortly after. The last pockets of resistance were eliminated earlier today, and the German flag now waves from the Rosenbad building."

 cityfall.12.t:0 "The Fall of Stockholm"
 cityfall.12.d:0 "The Red Army, after battling their way down the Sveavägen and into Stockholm proper, has taken the city after fighting for most of the day. Swedish militias still fight on in the cities outer boroughs, and the remaining trained units fortified themselves in the Stockholm Palace, but otherwise, the battle for Stockholm is over.\n\nThe country's leadership has escaped, hurried away after the opening shots were fired, but the Swedish state has been shaken to its very core and the the Red Banner is now hung from every important building in the city. Those with sympathies for their new overlords have already emerged from obscurity with the Red Army teams are already supporting their respective militias."
 cityfall.12.a:0 "The shadow of communism now looms over Scandinavia."
 cityfall.12.b:0 "The workers of Sweden stand with us, onward comrades!"
 cityfall.12.c:0 "As long as we fight, we shall never fall!"
 cityfall.13.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.13.d:0 "To the sound of deafening artillery fire, the field marshal leading the army that captured Berlin for good has given a speech from the remains of the Brandenburg Gate. After a fierce battle which had consumed the city until only a few hours prior, and which, in the cities outer boroughs and in her U-Bahn, is still being fought, Chinese forces successfully stormed the Reichstag.\n\nWhen news of the Reichstag's fall spread, demoralized German forces began surrendering en masse, and now, with the last bastions of defiance being snuffed out like candles, more and more are surrendering.\n\nIs the final defeat for Germany?"
 cityfall.13.a:0 "An unexpected development."
 cityfall.13.b:0 "Our victory is inevitable!"
 cityfall.13.c:0 "They might have won the battle, but they will not win the war!"
 cityfall.14.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.14.d:0 "The glorious forces of the Royal Bhutan Army have recently laid waste over the deviant city of Berlin and its defenders. Whatever pathetic defenses the Germans managed to organize collapsed within hours under the assaults of the heroic Bhutanese stormtroopers.\n\nGerman forces surrendered man by man after the Bhutanese forced blitzed into the Reichstag, taking over the building after only half an hour of fighting, which resulted in one Bhutanese soldier wounded and two hundred pitiful German soldiers dead.\n\nThe citizens of Berlin celebrate their liberation by the hands of the heroic Bhutanese troops, and the many statues and effigies of the old regime have began to be torn down to open place for statues worthy being glimpsed upon; those of our glorious realm!"
 cityfall.14.a:0 "Good Lord!"
 cityfall.14.b:0 "No filthy barbarians will be able to stop our divine-led armies!"
 cityfall.14.c:0 "T-This is not the end, we will win...eventually!"
 cityfall.15.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.15.d:0 "Surprising news today, as squadrons from the Irish army successfully captured the British capital of London after taking the better part of a day fighting. Although resistance is still fierce in much of the city, with British units still occupying Ealing and Islington, and British Home Guards holding out with police forces in the Scotland Yard.\n\nBut these are footnotes on the battle, as most of the major landmarks have fallen to Irish units and fireteams of Irish commandos are organizing to snuff out the last of resistance."
 cityfall.15.a:0 "Can anyone doubt the Irish now?"
 cityfall.15.b:0 "Celebrate, oh proud Irishmen, for the Eternal Anglo has been beheaded!"
 cityfall.15.c:0 "We should have struck them down a long time ago, bloody hell!"
 cityfall.16.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.16.d:0 "Another inevitable victory on the long path of Bhutanese conquest happened today. The Bhutanese Royal Army successfully rooted out the defenders of London after they desperately failed to even put a chink in the elite legions of the Thunder Dragon.\n\nThe British, a people now living under our ever fair and glorious regime, already starting the process of integration into our realm. \n\nAfter the first Bhutanese soldiers entered the city, the local military commander immediately ordered a cowardly retreat. Several of his men attempted to resist the order, but their defiance proofed to be in vain in face of the superior Bhutanese numbers.\n\nThe people of London are already out their houses, celebrating the entrance of their liberators!"
 cityfall.16.a:0 "The thunder dragon flies north."

 cityfall.17.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.17.d:0 "Chinese troops today raise their flag today over the steeples of Wesminster Abbey. The historic landmark had been the final bastion of resistance to be taken by Chinese forces, with British forces in Scotland Yard and Kingston upon Thames finally surrendering.\n\nThe conquest of London, one of the many achievements of the Chinese armed forces in recent times, marks a significant upturn in the Chinese campaign against the United Kingdom, which seems to have truly been decided now."
 cityfall.17.a:0 "The Chinese have finally come out on top."

 cityfall.18.d:0 ""History shows that there are no invincible armies." ~ Joseph Stalin\n\nDespite the desperate last stand by numerous forces, ranging from the US Marine Corps, to National Guard units from over twenty states, down to the Secret Service and those of the local police forces, Washington D.C. has fallen to Soviet troops.\n\nThe last shots are still being fired by local resistance fighters, bravely resisting the Soviet onslaught even as their city burns around them, but the battle for the most part, is over. Soviet tanks stay idle on the South Lawn and the Red Banner is now triumphantly hanging from the Washington Monument."
 cityfall.18.a:0 "Is this the last breath of freedom?"
 cityfall.18.b:0 "The worker's of the United States shall be free!"

 cityfall.19.t:0 "The Fall of Washington"
 cityfall.19.d:0 "After hard fighting for most of the day, Washington D.C., capital of the United States, has fallen to the armies of the Rising Sun. After numerous attempts to keep the enemy on the other side of the Potomac, Japanese troops eventually encircled the city and decimated local defenses along the Beltway. Following the fall of the two barriers, Japanese soldiers methodically took the city, building by building, razing most of the historic landmarks as came across them.\n\nNow with the Washington Monument laying in ruins over the National Mall, and the White House burning freely, the American experiment may have finally failed."

 cityfall.20.t:0 "The Fall of Washington"
 cityfall.20.d:0 "Benito Mussolini was flown to Washington D.C. today to give a speech over the ruins of the former American capital. The battle there, having been fought fiercely for the better part of days, ended after a retreat of the American troops there was called. The Americans fought until the Italian flag was hoisted over the White House, and when they saw the capital building they finally gave up the fight.\n\nThe fall of Washington D.C. is one of many landmarks marking Italy as the emerging superpower of the world, something Mussolini's speech will most likely touch upon."
 cityfall.20.a:0 "American Empire? Pft."
 cityfall.20.b:0 "Mare Nostrum? Maria Nostra!"
 cityfall.20.c:0 "The brave people of the free world will never surrender!"
 cityfall.21.t:0 "The Fall of Washington"
 cityfall.21.d:0 "After a raging battle that has ended with most of Washington D.C. in flames, Mexican troops have announced victory in their campaign in the American East Coast.\n\nAlthough resistance is still left to be tackled on by the Mexicans, the battle for Washington D.C. marks what may have be the final nail in the coffin for the United States war effort, who are now reeling in disarray after the stunning Mexican victory. The battle, which left thousands of Americans and Mexicans dead, is perhaps the final act of century-long conflict."
 cityfall.21.a:0 "It seems a new power has taken over the Americas."
 cityfall.21.b:0 "Viva la México!"

 cityfall.22.t:0 "The Fall of Washington"
 cityfall.22.d:0 "During the war of 1812, British forces under the command of Major General Robert Ross successfully captured and burned down much of Washington, including the White House. Many to this day mistakenly attribute the victory to Canadian troops, and a popular legend says the Canadians had burnt the White House to the ground.\n\nThis is no longer a legend, however, as Canadian troops have today proven once and for all that they can also raze the American capital. After fighting through the streets Canadian soldiers ransacked and then burned down the American Capitol. A bitter mark on the continued fall of the United States."
 cityfall.22.a:0 "Oh my."

 cityfall.23.d:0 "Forces of the Wehrmacht announced victory today after Yugoslavian forces retreated from the city of Belgrade. The city, heavily damaged after several hours of fighting, fell as a decisive German encirclement forced out Yugoslavian reinforcements and supply trains. The remaining Yugoslav forces, seeing their chance to escape becoming narrower, made their final stand against the German enemy.\n\nThe fall of Belgrade marks a shocking end to Yugoslavia; a nation of many, that singlehandedly sustained the dream of a unified Southern Slavic nation under her state where mutual security could be assured, but not even a idea could resist the German hammer."
 cityfall.23.a:0 "The blitzkrieg continues."
 cityfall.23.b:0 "Eastern, Western or Southern. All the same!"

 cityfall.24.t:0 "The Fall of Belgrade"
 cityfall.24.d:0 "Italian forces, despite bitter resistance from the combined forces of the Yugoslavian military, have taken Belgrade after a long fight that has left most of the city in ruins. The Italians are still rooting out the last of the local forces arrayed against them, but many of the Yugoslav forces have thrown off their uniforms and joined a growing partisan movement against the Italian invaders.\n\nThe victory has been a massive boon to Italian propaganda, which is already painting the battle as a great stepping zone to bringing the Balkans under Italian suzerainty."
 cityfall.24.a:0 "Mussolini is another step closer to his dream."
 cityfall.24.b:0 "We have triumphantly returned to Illyricum."

 cityfall.25.d:0 "Although Greeks once ruled the lands that are now Yugoslavia, in the days of the Byzantine Empire, the area was always tenuously held and has fallen from Imperial control for almost a millennia.\n\nAlthough the empires of old are long dead, the Greeks have now returned to the city of Belgrade, which has recently been taken after a decisive Greek offensive. Although Greek troops now face fierce resistance, especially in the areas of Ada Ciganlija and Fontana, the Greek flag has been raised over the National Assembly and the last proper military units in the area have surrendered."

 cityfall.26.d:0 "The Red Army has recently announced victory in the battle for the the city of Belgrade, the fight ended after the last of Yugoslavian forces surrendered by the banks of the Veliko Ratno Ostrvo, now renamed Ostrvo Narodnog Oslobodenja.\n\nAlthough the event came to no surprise to outside observers, it was no less of a shock to the people of Yugoslavia, who have now watch their country fall around them and now face the reality of the Soviet regime, which has already begun imposing harsh laws and occupation policies to squash any resistance that might sprout in the future."
 cityfall.26.a:0 "There might not exist invincible armies, but the Red Army comes close to that."

 cityfall.27.t:0 "The Fall of New York"
 cityfall.27.d:0 "Fires rage across what was once one of the world's greatest cities, as New York City falls before the might of the Red Army. After fierce fighting, the Soviets fought their way through the city and through line after line of a mix of proper troops and militias.\n\nDespite the attempts by numerous American forces to stave off the Soviets, the overwhelming numbers of the Red Army eventually won the day, and eventually the Red Banner was hoisted over the, surprisingly near intact, Statue of Liberty, renamed to the Statue of Equality.\n\nResistance is increasingly fierce in many of the cities boroughs and the Soviets will most likely be fighting insurgents in the city for years to come..."

 cityfall.28.d:0 "American forces have entered Dublin today and successfully taken the city after several hours of fighting with Irish forces. The battle was difficult, but the American victory was inevitable, as the overwhelming numbers of the US army came down upon the Irish capital.\n\nThe Irish still fight on, and already American occupation units have begun facing unrelenting insurgents, namely in the countryside. The American troops have a long job ahead of them, as the insurgency is already getting rapidly bigger by the minute."

 cityfall.29.d:0 "Today the German commander behind the divisions over at Ireland announced the city garrison's formal surrender, after remaining Irish forces mostly centered in Trinity College and Kilmainham Gaol, were bombarded for hours by a massive amount of German artillery and aircraft.\n\nThe battle marks an end to the fight for proper organized defenses in Dublin, and although Irish military units survive to fight on elsewhere, without the central authority of Dublin there is no longer much for them to held upon. Many have already begun discarding their uniforms, deciding to instead fight underground against the invading German forces."

 cityfall.30.d:0 "Ever since the Irish threw off the shackles of British control in the 1920's, there has been a true fear that the English may one day would return to Ireland. These fears have finally been realized now, when, after heavy fighting, English forces successfully fought off the Irish defenders and raised the Union Jack over the city of Dublin.\n\nThe Irish still fight fiercely, bombing English military vehicles and assassinating local military officials, the people rallying around their millennial struggle for independence from the English, but for now, it seems that Ireland may have fallen again."

A tattered Russian banner hands between all of them.\n\nToday, as the last shots ring across the Arbat and down the halls of the GUM, all seven men besides one, who is severely crippled from a blast of shrapnel, lie dead.

Although the Poles faced fierce resistance as they pushed through Bethesda and Fort Meade, the capital itself fell relatively quickly thanks to the antics of the Polish special services.\n\nSneaking through the cities old sewers, a team managed to infiltrate the American white house and, thinking that the battle had already been finished thanks to a temporary lull in the fighting and a coincidental lack of American defenders in the building, hoisted the Polish flag from the top.

Although they now wear khaki instead of red, and carry rifles instead of flintlocks, the British have nevertheless made their return. Initially, a huge procession through Times Square and down the streets of the city were planned, but after a bomb went off in the gathering squadron of soldiers, killing twelve, all further parades have been cancelled, and the British soldiers have instead set about cracking down on the locals."
