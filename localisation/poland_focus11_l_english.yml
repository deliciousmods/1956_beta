 poland.178.d:0 "In 1934, the PPS estabalished paramilitary units to protect party gatherings from nationalist gangs. The Socialist Action militia wore navy blue uniforms and swore an oath of absolute obediance to the party. Through youth groups, trade unions, and eventual expanded membership to female units, enrollment in the organization grew to over ten thousand members. Socialist Action units trained in urban combat, sabotage, and espionage activities. As the threat of the second world war loomed, an agreement of cooperation was established with the Polish army for the Socialist Action to particpate in subversive activities in support of the armed forces. Socialist Action's urban combat expertise would later form the basis for the creation of the Workers' Defense Brigades during the siege of Warsaw and then in the left-leaning resistance group, the WRN People's Guard."
