 #The Winter Base
 DEN_the_winter_base:0 "The Winter Base"
 DEN_the_winter_base_desc:0 "Greenland is a featureless wasteland of ice, devoid of use except for a small naval base. A little expansion and fortification would go a long way to making it a powerful staging area for future operations."

 DEN_fund_danish_universities:0 "Fund Danish Universities"
 DEN_fund_danish_universities_desc:0 "Denmark is filled to the brim with great minds who lack the resources to bring out the full potential in themselves and their country. We can and must remedy this. A program of government-subsidised higher education is both logical and necessary."
