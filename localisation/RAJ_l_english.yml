 r56_raj.110.a:0 "Off to war we go!"
 
 r56_raj.111.t:0 "The War Powers Act fails"
 r56_raj.111.d:0 "The Act was a hard sell for many Indians, Hindu and Muslim alike.

Our secondary goal will be to meet with the native high courts, holding a large amount of power in the provinces. Whatever we can do to secure their loyalty will get the upmost priority."
