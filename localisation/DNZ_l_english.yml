This compromise was necessary instead of a full annexation because the vast majority of the population of Danzig is ethnically German. \n\n The rise of ultra-nationalism in Germany has brought in total control of the local institutions to the NSDAP. Currently, those Nazi politicians' desire of reunification with Germany are kept relatively quiet, but this could change soon. In case of a crisis, the City-State would most likely disappear and be annexed by Poland or Germany."
