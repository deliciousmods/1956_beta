NIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The scars of Augusto Caesar Sandino's rebellion against the government and the American occupation troops are still visible on Nicaraguan society and politics, even more so since the collapse of the economy, mainly based on coffee exports, following the Great Depression.\n\nJuan Bautista Sacasa, who became president in 1933, saw and is partly responsible for the rise to power of the head of the national guard, Anastasio Somoza García, who had taken charge of Sandino's murder in 1934.\n\nIt seems that the fall of Sacasa is near...."

NIC_reinstate_national_guard_control:0 "Reinstate Guardia Nacional Control"
NIC_reinstate_national_guard_control_desc:0 "Now that the limits imposed on candidates are no longer on the agenda, Somoza can resume his role as head of the Guardia Nacional, which, combined with the position of President, should give him full control over Nicaragua's armed forces."
NIC_nkvd_assistance:0 "NKVD Assistance"
NIC_nkvd_assistance_desc:0 "We can learn a lot from the NKVD, whose effectiveness is no longer in question. Now that our relations with the Soviet Union are at their best, we could ask them to send some high-ranking members of their secret services to train our own."
NIC_the_strength_of_moscow:0 "The Strength of Moscow"
NIC_the_strength_of_moscow_desc:0 "An alliance with the United States as much as with Germany could end up threatening our sovereignty and above all Somoza's legitimacy. An alliance with the Soviet Union, however unlikely it may be, could well be the most beneficial."
NIC_begin_a_political_crackdown:0 "Begin a Purge of the Opposition"
NIC_begin_a_political_crackdown_desc:0 "A few voices continue to doubt Somoza's legitimacy despite a very clear election victory. We can tolerate a small opposition, as long as it does not or only slightly affect the elites, while for the most radical, they will suffer the same fate as Sandino."

NIC_support_of_the_psn:0 "Support of the PSN"
NIC_support_of_the_psn_desc:0 "Paradoxically, the Partido Socialista Nicaragüense proclaimed its support for Anastasio Somoza García, seeing him as an anti-fascist ally. With their support, our regime will probably be better seen not only by the Nicaraguan left, but by the world."
NIC_begin_forcibly_annexing_nicaraguan_german_land:0 "Seize Nicaragua-German Land"
NIC_begin_forcibly_annexing_nicaraguan_german_land_desc:0 "We can use the war with Germany to force the small but influential German community in Nicaragua to sell their possessions and land for a bite, so that it can be bought by Somoza's relatives and family."
NIC_the_somoza_family_fortune:0 "The Somoza Family Fortune"
NIC_the_somoza_family_fortune_desc:0 "Somoza's family's almost total control over Nicaragua's economy and politics has allowed her to amass a substantial fortune and control a huge part of the land."
NIC_soviet_economic_assistance:0 "Soviet Economic Assistance"
NIC_soviet_economic_assistance_desc:0 "The industrial success of the USSR is unquestionable. Perhaps we, too, as a small agrarian nation, could become a fully industrialized nation following the Russian model?"
NIC_combat_fruit_industries_influence:0 "Combat the Fruit Industry's Influence"
NIC_combat_fruit_industries_influence_desc:0 "The influence of the United Fruit Company on Nicaragua is beginning to become embarrassing, not only for the Somoza family but also for our Soviet allies. It is time to put an end to their influence."

NIC_lend_lease_for_docking_rights_desc:0 "In exchange for support in terms of armaments, we could offer the United States the right to park their ships in our ports in order to help them control the Caribbean."
NIC_foreign_concessions_on_gold_exploitation:0 "Foreign Concessions on Gold Exploitation"
NIC_foreign_concessions_on_gold_exploitation_desc:0 "By making concessions to American companies for gold, rubber and wood, we could ensure strong economic support for Nicaragua."
NIC_ally_the_champion_of_europe:0 "Ally the Champion of Europe"
NIC_ally_the_champion_of_europe_desc:0 "It is clear that Germany is Europe's new master power. By joining forces with them, we could ensure that Nicaragua receives a share in the new order."
NIC_push_south:0 "Strike South"
NIC_push_south_desc:0 "To the south is Costa Rica, a weak nation led by a similarly weak government. By invading them, we could prove the effectiveness of the Nicaraguan army to our new allies."
NIC_steel_trade:0 "Steel Trade"
NIC_steel_trade_desc:0 "A commercial contract with Germany for iron and steel will allow us to operate our plants much more efficiently and at a lower cost."

NIC_uproot_banditry:0 "Uproot Banditry"
NIC_uproot_banditry_desc:0 "Nicaragua's cruel terrain has allowed groups of bandits to form and easily attack the central government. It is time to put an end to it."
NIC_regulate_the_national_railroads:0 "Regulate the National Railroads"
NIC_regulate_the_national_railroads_desc:0 "Somoza, by appointing himself as the director of the Pacific Railroad, will be able to ensure the proper management of the latter as well as the other railroads in the country."
NIC_health_services:0 "Health Services"
NIC_health_services_desc:0 "Access to decent care remains limited in some parts of Nicaragua, yet a sick population is a weak population. It is time to expand access to health care."

nicaragua.1.t:0 "Somoza seizes power"
nicaragua.1.d:0 "It came to no ones surprise when earlier this morning that Anastasio Somoza Garcia has asked [ROOT.getleader] to step down as president of Nicaragua. Somoza and the Guardia Nacional under his control have waged a campaign of assassinations and terrorism against Somoza's political opponents since the 1933 power-sharing agreement. The country has been in a Presidential crisis since the middle of 1935, a crisis that many thought would plunge the country into chaos. [ROOT.getleader] has decided to avoid a possible civil war and step down, rather than try to maintain his grip on power. The [USA.getname] who brokered the 1933 deal have washed their hands of the situation and don't care about what to many pundits is essentially the fall of democracy in Nicaragua.\n \n Anastasio Somoza Garcia has appointed a temporary president that is a mere puppet for him. New elections will be organized, though many suspect that there will election fraud that will be naturally in favor of Anastasio Somoza Garcia."
