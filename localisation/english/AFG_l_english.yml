 afghanistan.1.d:0 "During our time of need, a local tribe in has approached us with an offer of military service. The tribe, known for their fierce fighting skills and loyalty, is willing to provide soldiers to bolster our army's ranks.\n\nHowever, this offer comes with potential consequences. The tribe will expect preferential treatment and may demand a larger role in our military operations. If granted, this could lead to our army becoming more reliant on these tribes, potentially causing tension with other factions within the country."
