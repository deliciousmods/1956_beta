The small yet fragile country still suffers from the scars of the Civil War of 1929, which tore the poor nation apart and led to a sharp decline in the Afghan economy. \n\nSince the brutal assassination of Nadir Shah in 1933, the country has been de-facto led by the Regency Council overseeing the deeds of young Mohammad Zahir Shah. However, with dark clouds looming on the horizon, Afghanistan's future remains uncertain..."

 ######## LOYA JIRGA EVENTS ########

 AFG_loya_jirga.1.t:0 "The [GetYear] Loya Jirga Begins"
 AFG_loya_jirga.1.desc:0 "For centuries the Pashtun social code dictated the cultural and social norms among the common folk and privileged members of the society. According to its statute, the heads of the country together with the tribal leaders hold an annual meeting of the Loya Jirga to discuss the country's path during these unsettling times. \n\nThis year's Jirga is expected to focus primarily on the social status of women, Kābul's industrialization and recently introduced school reforms, and the foreign policy of the nation. The King accompanied by his cabinet members is expected to arrive in a few hours. We received information that some of the Nimruz and Farah farmers are unhappy with supplies redistribution, while the Northerners from Takhar are concerned about the recent Basmachi raids in their heartlands. Some of the army members are also expected to voice their dissatisfaction with the current modernization plan. On the other side, we anticipate to receive an overwhelming ammount of support from Kābul where the first ever university in the country was just recently opened.\n\nThe King was advised to take a firm stance on the matter of the army, but be ready to provide some concessions if discussion becomes too heated. All in all, we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the 1928 Loya Jirga."
 AFG_loya_jirga.1.a:0 "We will make sure not to miss it."

 AFG_loya_jirga.2.t:0 "The Status of Women"
 AFG_loya_jirga.2.desc:0 "The tribal leaders have been very traditional when it comes to the social status of women and their rights in Afghanistan, and they would be very unpleased if we granted more rights to women which would violate the Pashtunwali and the customs of Pashtun people. We must be careful, as a single step in the wrong direction can cause discontent!"
 AFG_loya_jirga.2.a:0 "Lets try to appease them..."
 AFG_loya_jirga.2.b:0 "No can do! Rights of women shall not be infringed."

 AFG_loya_jirga.3.t:0 "The Foreign Policy"
 AFG_loya_jirga.3.desc:0 "The political state of Afghanistan has been very polarized when it comes to the foreign policy of the nation, some long for the return of the previous King, Amanullah, while others have other contrasting ambitions. We must unite these tribes' aspirations into a single common goal, divided we are weak, united we are strong!"
 AFG_loya_jirga.3.a:0 "To keep Afghanistan united, that is our goal!"
 AFG_loya_jirga.3.b:0 "Uniting the tribes, an impossible task..."

 AFG_loya_jirga.4.t:0 "The Development of Afghanistan"
 AFG_loya_jirga.4.desc:0 "The tribal leaders have requested of the government to subsidize infrastructure projects or open new factories many times, however, the King and his Regency has refused these proposals every time, if we wish to keep the people content we must also improve the standard of life of our compatriots!"
 AFG_loya_jirga.4.a:0 "Certainly an interesting proposal..."
 AFG_loya_jirga.4.b:0 "The government cannot spare anything currently."

 AFG_loya_jirga.5.t:0 "The End of the [GetYear] Loya Jirga"
 AFG_loya_jirga.5.desc:0 "With all the tribal leaders and speakers being heard, the [GetYear] Loya Jirga has concluded.[GetLoyaJirgaEventDesc]. It is now time for us to act upon the proposals and wishes of the memebers of the Jirga that they have put forward. We have ample time to do this, however, taking too long will most likely anger the tribal leaders."
 AFG_loya_jirga.5.a:0 "Great."

 AFG_loya_jirga_good:0 "During the Jirga, the King and his Government took a reconciliatory and friendly stance towards the members of the Jirga and expressed their wish for cooperation. The Kābul Times described this years Jirga as democratic and straightforward"
 AFG_loya_jirga_bad:0 "During the Jirga, the King and his Government took an agressive and unfriendly stance towards reform and the members of the Jirga, this was met with a lot of resistance by the members of the Jirga and was highly criticized by the Kābul Times and many other news agencies"

 AFG_loya_jirga.10.t:0 "The Course of the 1936 Loya Jirga"
 AFG_loya_jirga.10.d:0 "The Loya Jirga will commence shortly, this provides us with the sufficient ammount of time to determine and the political course of this year's Jirga. The Regency, consisting of Prime Minister Mohammad Hashim Khan and War Minister Shah Mahmud Khan has advised the King to continue the policy of centralization and reform. This has been met with resistance from many of the tribal folk which are unsympathetic towards the reforms that are being put through which are opposed to the Pashtunwali, the Pashtun code of living. \n\nThese simple folk only wish for the stability of Afghanistan and their cultural customs to be respected, perhaps if we offer them concessions such as local autonomy and ratifying the Hasht Nafari they will wish to cooperate with the government."
 AFG_loya_jirga.10.a:0 "Push for reforms!"
 AFG_loya_jirga.10.b:0 "Perhaps we can reach a compromise."

 ######## OTHER EVENTS ########

 afghanistan.1.t:0 "Local Tribes Offer Assistance"
 afghanistan.1.d:0 "During our time of need, a local tribe in has approached us with an offer of military service. The tribe, known for their fierce fighting skills and loyalty, is willing to provide soldiers to bolster our army's ranks.\n\nHowever, this offer comes with potential consequences. The tribe will expect preferential treatment and may demand a larger role in our military operations. If granted, this could lead to our army becoming more reliant on these tribes, potentially causing tension with other factions within the country."
