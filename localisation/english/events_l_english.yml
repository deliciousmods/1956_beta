 germany.5.t:0 "Anti-Comintern Pact"
 germany.5.d:1 "Continuous rhetoric of [GER.getNameDef] and its leadership of establishing a unified front against the spread of the red menace have reached cabinets of the most isolated government facilities of our nation. \n\nOur officials have already received many joyful proposals and some concerned requests regarding such alignment with [GER.getNameDef]. \n\nThe secret telegram was delivered this morning in which [GER.getLeader] proposes that we sign a pact to address the Comintern's goal of spreading Communism worldwide, through the use of subversion and violence. By signing this pact, we agree to share intelligence on the Communist threat and act in close cooperation against this menace. \n\nOn the other side, the proposal features only the share of the intelligence and mentions the possibility of joint military alliance or any sort mutual defense cooperation very briefly. By resisting the official participation in the pact we will worsen our relations with [GER.getNameDef], yet it might save us from the alienation and retaliation by [SOV.getNameDef]."

 germany.6.d:0 "The signatories consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned."

 germany.11.d:0 "The [GER.getAdjective] Foreign Ministry have proposed a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This treaty will greatly increase our mutual trade and commerce while providing [SOV.getAdjective] research facilities with missing specialists and technological advancements from [GER.getNameDef]. \nAn additional secret protocol suggests the division of Eastern Europe into [GER.getAdjective] and [SOV.getAdjective] spheres of influence. \n\nWhile the [GER.GetRulingIdeology]s in Berlin may not be trustworthy for clear reasons, this pact will allow us to deal with [FIN.getNameDef], the Baltic States and [ROM.getNameDef] without fear of outside interference. The Eastern territories of [POL.getNameDef] will also befall us in the event of a [POL.getAdjective] collapse."

 germany.12.d:0 "Official response from [SOV.getNameDef] officials was received relatively late considering the length and significance of the agreement we proposed, with official [SOV.getAdjective] ambassador in Berlin handed in the signed copy of the document to the respective [GER.getAdjective] diplomat. \n\nThe note stated that [SOV.getNameDef] in face of [SOV.getLeader] agreed to sign our non-aggression pact and will follow the stipulations of the treaty to its final words and according to the all official protocols mentioned within the paper. \n\nThis means that we are free to act without risk of [SOV.getAdjective] intervention and [SOV.getAdjective] resources will be available for our use should we start any sort of military or civilian campaign. \n\nUnfortunately, some of our friends now question [GER.getNameDef]'s commitment towards the ultimate destruction of communism. When matters with [POL.getNameDef] and [FRA.getNameDef] have been settled, we may need to revisit this treaty, but that is a discussion for another time..."
 germany.12.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.13.t:0 "Moscow Rejects the Pact"
 germany.13.d:0 "Recent message from our spies in Moscow and its surroundings suggest that [SOV.getNameDef] has refused to sign our non-aggression pact. \n\nMoreover, [SOV.getLeader] has made an official speech this morning to the population of the country, in which he denounced our proposal of peace and prosperity in Eastern Europe as "...an inferior effort of puny [GER.getAdjective] leadership to gain trust of [SOV.getAdjective] people only to betray us as long as our assistance will not be needed... " \n\nWhile reading the report, [GER.getLeader] had his face turn white with hands shaking and mentioning something of "Verräter....Verräter" \nThis complicates matters, since we cannot deal decisively with [POL.getNameDef] or [FRA.getNameDef] without the risk of the [SOV.getAdjective]s getting themselves involved."
 germany.13.a:0 "Curse them!"
 germany.14.t:0 "The Partitioning of Poland"
 germany.14.desc:0 "Poland is ours, but the eastern parts fall under the [SOV.GetAdjective] sphere of influence according to the stipulations of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

 germany.20.d:0 "Recognizing that a new order has been established in Europe, we have been asked by [HUN.getNameDef] and [ROM.getNameDef] to arbitrate in a territorial dispute between the two countries. Transylvania was taken from [HUN.getNameDef] and incorporated into [ROM.getNameDef] in one of the many ill-conceived changes forced upon the world at Versailles.

 germany.23.t:0 "Memel - [188.controller.GetNameDef] Refuses Demand"
 germany.23.d:0 "The [188.controller.getAdjective] government has refused our demands! They are hiding behind the Klaipeda Convention, claiming that [GER.getNameDef] has no legal right to the Memel territory. We shall have to explain our position to them by different means..."

 germany.24.d:0 "[GER.getNameDefCap] has enjoyed good relations with China since the end of the previous Weltkrieg, despite the loss of our Chinese possessions. A [GER.getAdjective] military mission has been present in China for a number of years, and Alexander von Falkenhausen has made great progress in reforming parts of the Kuomintang army. \n\nThis is naturally of some concern to the [JAP.getAdjective], given their present war against China. They are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all [GER.getAdjective] support to the [CHI.getAdjective]."

 germany.43.t:0 "France leaves the Allies"

 germany.46.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
 germany.47.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia.

We must make certain we are ready for this."
 germany.47.a:0 "Time to do this the hard way."
 germany.48.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British have seen reason and accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, but the stubborn French are refusing to back down.\n\nThey have abandoned their cooperation with Britain and forged closer ties with the Czechs instead.

 germany.68.t:0 "France Refuses to Back Down"
 germany.68.d:0 "The French have stubbornly decided to go at it alone against the Germans, and our alliance with them has been rescinded. Yet another European war has broken out due to pointless squabbling. Perhaps it is time for Britain to distance itself from continental affairs again..."

 germany.73.d:0 "The heavy fighting in Berlin has reduced the capital to a burning ruin.

Coming from the oil industry, Landon wants to see greater economic freedom, while Roosevelt and the Democratic Party want to expand Social Security and ensure economic stability.

However, in light of the precarious state of the world and international developments in the last few years, President Roosevelt has decided to break with tradition and run for a third term. Republican Wendell Willkie, characterized as a dark horse candidate with a background as an industrialist with limited political experience, has been critical both of Roosevelt's economic interventionism and his justifications for running for a third term.\n\nAlthough the candidates have much in common in their foreign policies and Willkie wants to retain some form of the New Deal, many still consider this election a determining point for the future of American democracy."

Roosevelt, who has continued to campaign in favor of completing the programs he originally planned for his second term, is now running for president again. While he remains a popular candidate, Landon has continued to criticize his efforts to concentrate power in the hands of the president, and has accordingly avoided similar policies himself.\n\nThreats abroad, both to our own nation and others, remain a reality and neither candidate is in favor of the United States turning a blind eye to them.

General Douglas MacArthur has been a popular nominee among the conservatives, but he is also an indispensable asset in the ongoing conflict and has been reluctant to spend his time campaigning for the presidency.\n\nHe nevertheless remains one of the more promising conservative candidates and can perhaps be convinced to campaign to avoid getting a moderate Republican president. Is it worth the sacrifice?"

Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."

The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler.

While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."

He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically.

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

 political.3.t:0 "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"

They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."

 political.8.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."

Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."

 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."

In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly.

Today, Lev Trotsky reemerged as having returned from his exile, and with the support of several influential party members and NKVD officers, launched a coup overthrowing Stalin's rule.\n\nThe former General Secretary was attacked in his home with an ice axe, and was swiftly executed along with several of his supporters. Tearing down the cult of personality he built up will take time, but the people know now at least that he was not immortal.\n\n One of the few survivors who managed to escape was Ivan Konev.

Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught.

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind.

The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work.
