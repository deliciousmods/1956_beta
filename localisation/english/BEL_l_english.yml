 BEL_raoul_overstraeten_desc:0 "Raoul Van Overstraeten was one of the closest military advisors of the king, which is why he was nicknamed "the viceroy" (at least on military matters). He was also a lecturer at the Royal Military School and had published multiple books in the 1920s, in which he foresaw the future importance of tanks in warfare. He also had a very peculiar opinion of the Belgian air force: he thought that as the air force was incapable of resisting a German attack, the army should not invest in any air force whatsoever and instead focus on anti-air artillery."

 BEL_joris_van_severen:0 "Joris Van Severen"
 BEL_joris_van_severen_desc:0 "Joris Van Severen was not a party leader, as Verdinaso was not a political party. Instead, it was a movement seeking the unity of the entire Benelux into a united corporatist state. Despite this, until 1935, he was a vehement Flemish nationalist before professing that the Walloons were cousins from the same blood and, as such, should be included in the union. More practically, dividing Belgium would mean splitting the Belgian Congo, which was in complete opposition to his dreams of greatness. In 1940, the Belgian authorities arrested him as a potential future collaborator. Moved to northern France with other fascists, he was killed by his disgruntled, drunk French guards."

He held some innovative views compared to the Belgian military establishment. He published articles where he suggested using tanks to enable deadly counterattacks that would stop enemy advances. Even if historically Belgium never had enough tanks to perform the kind of maneuvers suggested by his articles, it is clear that he advocated the use of mobile warfare in Belgium."
 BEL_henri_denis:0 "Henri Denis"
 BEL_henri_denis_desc:0 "Due to his military expertise as a retired general, Henri Denis served as the defense minister in successive governments. He oversaw the establishment of the Belgian defensive strategy and created the territorial anti-air guard. In 1940 he refused to follow the government in exile in London to stay with the king. He even said to Leopold III that he could sign the order of resignation of the government as the only minister left in the country. A move that would have harmed the legitimacy of the government of Hubert Pierlot. Fortunately, the king declined his proposal."
 BEL_edouard_van_den_bergen:0 "Édouard van den Bergen"
 BEL_edouard_van_den_bergen_desc:0 "Previously an artillery general, Édouard van den Bergen was named chief of staff in 1935. As the commander of the armed forces (after the king), he conceived a plan that would increase the length of military service and, consequently, the quality of the reserve divisions. This plan, however, was never implemented as it was judged more critical by the government to favor economic recovery over preparation for a war that was still only seen as hypothetical. He lost his position and commanded one of the army groups after he invited the French forces to cross the border into Belgium after one of the many false alarms of the "Phoney War" without consulting the king or the government."

 BEL_lambert_chardome:0 "Lambert Chardome"
 BEL_lambert_chardome_desc:0 "Lambert Chardome is a peculiar case. He commanded a division in 1940, but he may have plotted with Degrelle to help his "March on Brussels" and organize a coup. However, I have only found Degrelle's claim, which looks like another piece of his historical rewriting. Anyway, he was sent to prison, like most Belgian generals. In 1944, Léon Degrelle needed an officer to command the "Légion Wallonie", so he looked for anti-communist Belgian officers. Chardome was convinced after being told that the king agreed to fight the Soviets (even if Leopold III was undoubtedly not enamored with communists, he never expressed such views). But before joining the front, he asked for permission to return to Belgium and see his family. There he saw the country's situation and probably received more information about the general course of the war. He was convinced that this was not the right thing and returned to his stalag instead. Even if he never participated in the activities of the Legion, he was sentenced to 15 in prison after the war."

It had assets in many vital sectors of the Belgian economy, such as the "Union Minière du Haut-Katanga" in the Belgian Congo. During the war, he chose to stay in Belgium because he feared that without proper leadership, the corporation's assets would be seized by the occupying forces. Instead, he gave his name to the "Galopin Doctrine". It consisted of the idea that the economy has to keep running to pay the population's salaries. Even if it partially helped the Germans, these politics were supported by the Belgian government in exile as it was seen as a necessary evil compared to famine. In 1944 he was assassinated by Flemish fascists led by Robert Jan Verbelen because he represented the pre-war economic ruling class."

Nevertheless, our mining equipment is becoming obsolete, which could threaten the colony's economic efficiency in the future.\nConcerning the Public Force, it is almost entirely disorganized. Soldiers are equipped almost wholly with completely obsolete rifles while the officers are unmotivated. Consequently, only the most basic of security operations can be performed at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, the League of Nations has approved the report of Eugéne Jungers on his work in the mandated colonies of Ruanda and Urundi.
