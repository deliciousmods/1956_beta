The Kwantung Army will be assured, that they will retain their position of influence and that their officials will be appointed to government positions, legitimizing their continued presence, in exchange for the support of a Manchurian claim on all of China. If both Tojo and Itagaki support our endeavour, the rest of the Japanese Government will fall in line."

Two separate factions of interest have emerged, the Kwantung Army, advocating for a takeover of the General Affairs State Council, with General Doihara at the helm and the Industrialists and Investors under Aikawa and Naori, who advocate for maintaining civillian rule and the takeover by a strengthened Concordia Association, which is to be expanded as a mass organization similar to the fascist parties of europe. While these two factions are always at odds for increased influence over Manchuria, Kishi Nobosuke has managed to remain as mediator, having good relations with both sides. Being factually in control of the economy of the [MAN.GetName], some have started to call for him to assume the position of Chief Executive, posing as a compromise candidate."

The other option, favored by military officials, being the creation of a decentralized system with a respected Chinese Warlord in nominal control."
