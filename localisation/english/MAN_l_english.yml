Two separate factions of interest have emerged, the Kwantung Army, advocating for a takeover of the General Affairs State Council, with General Doihara at the helm and the Industrialists and Investors under Aikawa and Naori, who advocate for maintaining civillian rule and the takeover by a strengthened Concordia Association, which is to be expanded as a mass organization similar to the fascist parties of europe. While these two factions are always at odds for increased influence over Manchuria, Kishi Nobosuke has managed to remain as mediator, having good relations with both sides.
