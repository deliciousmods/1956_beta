 palestine.58.d:0 "After the formal declaration of the elections for the chairman of the Council, the ulema have gathered to elect a custodian of the prophet's first qibla, and the Caliph of Filisteen, many clans have tried to compete but the main rivalry is between the Husayni and Nashasbi clans, the Nashashbi's following a civil rights focus, and an emphasis on the Sunnah, However the Husayni's are hardline followers of the Sharia, and idolize the past Caliphs of Umar Ibn Khattab and Uthman Ibn Affan, the outcome will be decided 35 days from now."

 palestine.58.a:0 "We wish both clans the best."

 palestine.60.a:0 "He does have a point."
 palestine.60.b:0 "Nonesense! He's just being too soft."

 palestine.62.t:0 "Jarallah Abolishes Radicalism"
 palestine.62.d:0 "Chairman Hussam Al-Din Jarallah of the Palestinian Islamic Council after multiple situations in which he has criticized how our government has been handling Sharia and the government's laws, he has finally decided to take action against the Radicalist view of Islam. \n \n He has loosened the tight grip on life the previous radical government had, following the word of the prophet and refusing to lean to liberalism or radicalism, quality of life especially for women has increased, as it is no longer required for them to wear a face covering, making it mandatory to wear a Hijab instead."

 palestine.63.t:0 "Fascist Coup"
 palestine.63.d:0 "After Husam Al-Din Jarallah was shunned because of his discontent with the current government's handling, General Hasan Salama has gathered his men and executed a march into the Islamic Council, putting the building on lockdown while his other forces capture the remaining government buildings."

 palestine.6.t:0 "Arab High Committee Conference"

 palestine.7.a:0 "Aqidah! Fiqh! Akhlaq!"

 palestine.8.t:0 "Civilians Take Up Arms"
 palestine.8.d:0 "After the escalation of the Boycott Decree by Jamal Al-Husseini, aswell as his full claim of responsibility over it, Freedom fighting militants supportive of Islamist Democracy have risen all over the country from Hebron to Khan Yunis against the nationalist government, and this may spiral into a full-blown civil war if we do not handle it well."
 palestine.8.a:0 "Shura! Ijma! Al-Hurriya!"

 palestine.9.t:0 "SMC Takes Power"
 palestine.9.d:0 "After muslims all around palestine took up arms against the authoritarian dictatorship of Fawzi Al-Qawuqji, the police was now as paranoid as ever, and it has resulted into mass shootings and incidents with high casualties, as Palestine looked on the brink of collapse once again, Jamal Al-Husseini maneuvered his way out of this disaster and has managed to orchestrate a bloodless coup on the current government, by simply storming the hotels of many government officials as the guards were often to de-moralized to care."

 palestine.12.a:0 "Al-Fida'!"

 palestine.13.t:0 "Nashashbi Coup"
 palestine.13.d:0 "The Massacre of Nablus was the final straw for the Palestinian people, as conservatives, liberals and socialists alike started voicing dislike for the government, Raghib Nashashbi had planned this perfectly and police units started joining the cause, as Fawzi Al-Qawuqji thought he would immediately be executed so he proceeded to flee out of the country, making the Nashashbi Family fully incharge of the state."

 palestine.15.d:0 "Our diplomats have recently approached Prince Zeid bin Hussein of the house of Hashim, meetings were held to determine his power and his reign over the newly established Hashemite Kingdom of Palestine, as Abdul-Qadir was very fond of the hashemite family and the idea of a Hashemite king in Palestine.\n\nWhile the army wanted the king to be strictly constitutionalist, Abdul-Qadir forced their hand into establishing an absolute monarchy led by his majesty King Zeid Bin Hussein"
 palestine.15.a:0 "Allah! Al-watan! Al-Malik!"

 palestine.16.d:0 "After recent border negotiations between the heads of France and Palestine because of the growing discontent of syrian arabs over their overlords, and the palestinian claims for a Greater Palestine, further aiming to re-align the french-palestinian border, they have offered us a generous deal in which a pact of non-aggression will be made for the exchange of damascus, removing the constant threat of military border conflicts, that would further complicate matters."
 palestine.16.t:0 "Palestinian Efforts For Damascus"
 palestine.16.a:0 "We will not lose our holdings in Damascus!"
 palestine.16.b:0 "We could arrange a deal."

 palestine.17.d:0 "Our diplomatic effort to reshape the borders of Palestine and the ownership of damascus because of our new dreams of Greater Palestine has been halted because of the declination of our generous offer for damascus."

 palestine.22.t:0 "Abdul-Qadir's Leadership"
 palestine.22.d:0 "After Abdul-Qadir's push for a hashemite monarch was declined by the military, and as he didnt want to cause division in our nation he yielded, however a hashemite monarch was the unifying figure in Abdul-Qadir's ideology, as he believs in a mix of Islamism and Arab Nationalism, An arab, Hashemite absolute monarchy was his solution however he must decide on how to act, now that this figure is no longer achievable."
 palestine.22.a:0 "No Arabism without Islam!"
 palestine.22.b:0 "The Military knows best."

 palestine.23.t:0 "Second Expanded Leadership Meeting"

 palestine.23.a:0 "Great."

 palestine.25.t:0 "Talks Escalate"
 palestine.25.d:0 "As the generals are discussing a defence of the vital parts of our nation, Abdul-Qadir resorted to plainly insulting Abdul-Rahim over his idea of Entrenching the state and booby trapping the outside of cities and their vital parts, turning the discussion into a yelling competition where both generals crudely insult eachother and their families, The Shalaf must step in."
 palestine.25.a:0 "Qadir's plan makes most sense, we mustn't trap our entire nation!"
 palestine.25.b:0 "Abdul-Rahim is wiser, the entire state would be at stake!"
 palestine.25.c:0 "Al-Shalaf has the most experience in defence, not those two weaklings!"

 palestine.26.t:0 "Abdul-Qadir's Plan"
 palestine.26.d:0 "After the Shalaf stepped in favoring Abdul-Qadir's plan, the arguement quickly ended and a plan was made if the state of palestine is in peril, where Jerusalem and Jaffa are protected by fortifying ramallah, Bir As-Sab and Gaza, and focusing heavily on Morale and mental strength, valuing the common man in the military other than the high command."
 palestine.26.a:0 "La Tasqut Filastin"

 palestine.27.t:0 "Abdul-Rahim's Plan"
 palestine.27.d:0 "After the Shalaf stepped in favoring Abdul-Rahim's plan, the arguement quickly ceased, even if Abdul-Qadir was a little offput by it, a plan was agreed on where guerilla warfare will be heavily utilized, as Jaffa, Jerusalem and Ramallah, and entrenching ourselves within our land, while this does have a better chance of defending Palestine from a bigger foe, this does raise some worriness within our civilian populace"
 palestine.27.a:0 "Man Yaghzu sayajid Al-Mawt!"

 palestine.28.t:0 "Golani's Plan"
 palestine.28.d:0 "After the Shalaf stepped in to halt the arguement, he offered a compromise plan where he, the most experienced in defence would devise a plan of protecting the vital ports in Gaza, Tel-Aviv and Haifa, as they are crucial for any external supply or weapons to come, and play a major part in our military industrial complex."
 palestine.28.a:0 "Yaeesh Al-Shalaf!"

 palestine.64.t:0 "Victory Against Palestine"
 palestine.64.d:0 "Following the daring invasion of the Sinai by the Palestinian forces, they have issued a peace offering, as their operation cannot bear any entrance to their land, nor the failure to capture the sinai, truly, god is on our side."
 palestine.64.a:0 "We are victorious!"
 palestine.64.b:0 "No! We must push further!"

 palestine.65.t:0 "Loss In The Sinai War"
 palestine.65.d:0 "Unfortunately, due to our incompetence, and our failure to recapture the Sinai from the Palestinian Armed Forces, we are now being asked to concede and sign a peace treaty. Continuing the war could prove disasterous for our nation's stability."
