 r56_yugoslavia.4.t:0 "The Aging General"
 r56_yugoslavia.4.d:0 "Petar Živković, Commander of the Royal Guards Division, General of the Royal [YUG.GetAdjective] Army, Former Prime Minister of [YUG.GetNameDef] and current Minister of the Army and Navy has become a very conservative figure, by today's standards. During recent military exercises, the military French and British attachés present have noticed and pointed out Živković's lack of modern military knowledge and way of thinking. Živković, being the leader of the 'Bela Ruka', a secret military society loyal to the King, has become a key figure within the military with over 90% of the army supporting him, this makes him hardly replaceable. Thus, we are faced with a dilemma, either we implement the guidelines of the French and thus begin modernizing our military, as Živković's presence has incapacitated our modernization effort, or we maintain the status quo and the will of the people."
