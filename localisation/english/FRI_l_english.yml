 frenchindochina.1.d:0 "Jules Brevie, former Governor of French West Africa, was appointed by the [FRA.GetRulingParty] government as Governor-General of Indochina, replacing Rene Robin.\nA humanist and a liberal, Brevie is very much focused on an approach to colonization that he calls "scientific", starting from a profound study of indigenous cultures and the improvement of their living conditions, as he had implemented many social reforms during the Great Depression in French Africa, subsidizing Senegalese workers and setting up programs to increase food production.\nThe victory of the Popular Front in the [FRA.GetAdjective] elections raised great hopes among the Vietnamese in particular, with the appointment of Marius Moutet, a former opponent of the repression that followed the Yen Bai mutiny as Minister of Colonies, as well as Leon Blum at the head of the government, who was also strongly opposed to colonial repression.\nBrevie has planned the implementation of social reforms similar to those he implemented in Africa and those implemented in Metropolitan France."

 frenchindochina.2.t:0 "1936 Strikes"
 frenchindochina.2.d:0 "June saw the start of a significant strike movement in [FRI.GetNameDef], driven by a rise in prices added to the fall in wages that workers have been suffering for several years now. More than 300 of these movements have been recorded, involving hundreds of thousands of people up to the countryside where plantations are paralyzed with farmers mobilizing against taxes. The result is an economy that has stopped abruptly and separatist movements taking advantage of it to gain popularity and spread independence ideas among the population."

The breaking point was reached when soldiers of the Indigenous Guard mutinied at Yen Bai.\n\nIt only took a few hours for the mutiny to turn into a general insurgency, covering the entire Vietnam region.\nThe multiple pro-independence forces have consolidated their control in the country's north, while in the south, the colonial government is preparing to counterattack against the most significant anti-colonial rebellion that [FRI.GetNameDef] has ever known."

 FRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A pearl of the French colonial empire, Indochina is the most profitable French colony. Intended mainly for economic exploitation through its many raw materials, the French presence is relatively weak. The administration primarily relies on support from the indigenous elites, supported by the famous Indochinese riflemen.\n\nThe French presence has constantly been challenged, the most recent uprising being the Yen Bai mutiny in 1930. The economic devastation caused by the Great Depression could very well lead to a new wave of protest."
