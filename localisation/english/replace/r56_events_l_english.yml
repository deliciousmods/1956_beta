r56_on_action_event.1.d:0 "Changes in the political landscape of [GER.GetNameDef] has lead to the formation of the new governmental system which aims to pursue vastly different internal policies from their predecessors, where efforts are made to resolve social disputes and secure the order in the new state. \n\nTheir diplomats have already announced that the foreign agenda of the [GER.GetAdjective] state will also be severely impacted, including the renegotiations of former economic deals, revision of treaties and rebuking of diplomatic alliances on various levels of power. \n\nVoices within our administration are constantly questioning on whether [ROOT.getLeader] might realign [ROOT.GetHerHis] opinion towards [GER.GetNameDef] or will [ROOT.GetSheHe] rather retain it as long as the situation remains unclear?"
r56_on_action_event.1.a:0 "We shall renounce our stance towards them."
