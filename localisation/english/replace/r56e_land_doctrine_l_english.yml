mission_type_tactics:0 "Mission-type Tactics"
mission_type_tactics_desc:0 "The subordinate leader is given, to a large extent, the planning initiative and freedom in execution, which allows a high degree of flexibility at the operational and tactical levels of command.\n\n"
force_concentration:0 "Force Concentration"
force_concentration_desc:0 "Concentrating a military force in such a way as to exert overwhelming force against a portion of the enemy force can act as a force multiplier due to the significant disparity between the two forces."
tactical_command:0 "Tactical Command"
tactical_command_desc:0 "The authority delegated to a commander to assign tasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher authority."
 
 
ASYMMETRICAL_WARFARE_DOCTRINE:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
ASYMMETRICAL_WARFARE_DOCTRINE_DESC:0 "Against superior armies we must outwit our enemies tactically and make them pay for fighting in our homeland."
cat_r56_guerilla_warfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare Doctrine"
r56_guerilla_warfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
r56_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "There is a need to reform the operational methods of the armed forces. The reality is that the armies that could potentially be engaged in conflict possess a significant advantage. Therefore, adopting an asymmetrical approach to warfare becomes crucial in order to have a chance at achieving success or maintaining a competitive edge."
r56_double_envelopment:0 "Sudden Envelopment"
r56_double_envelopment_desc:0 "Envelopment, an age-old military tactic, can be employed when the enemy's forces are overextended and we possess superior knowledge of the terrain. By quickly surrounding and eliminating small enemy groups, we can prevent assistance and disrupt their larger forces, gaining a tactical advantage."
r56_elastic_defence:0 "Elastic Defense"
r56_elastic_defence_desc:0 "Instead of concentrating all strength on the front line, an elastic defense strategy involves establishing a "deeper" layer of defenses. This approach provides the defender with additional time to react and launch counter-attacks, while the attacker becomes dispersed and entangled."
r56_infiltration_assault:0 "Infiltration Assault"
r56_infiltration_assault_desc:0 "During the initial stages of an attack, infantry units should focus on identifying and targeting vulnerable points in the enemy's defensive line. By bypassing and isolating these weaker sections, the remaining attacking forces can then concentrate their efforts on neutralizing the more heavily fortified areas."
r56_infiltration_in_depth:0 "Deep Infiltration"
r56_infiltration_in_depth_desc:0 "Our forces are now trained to bypass and isolate enemy strongpoints to a much greater depth. Ideally, our assault forces should not stop until they reach the enemy's rear areas and their forces are entirely cut off."
r56_backhand_blow:0 "Backhand Blow"
r56_backhand_blow_desc:0 "Instead of engaging in a battle for every inch of ground, it is often more advantageous to avoid direct confrontation with enemy penetrations. Instead, the enemy is allowed to extend themselves, and when they have overcommitted, counterattacks can be launched to cut off and destroy them."

r56_nd_conscription:0 "Non-Discriminatory Conscription"
r56_nd_conscription_desc:0 "It is necessary to draft individuals with various physical conditions, including invalids and cripples. The concept of a civilian, as distinct from military service, does not exist in this context."
r56_peoples_army:0 "People's Army"
r56_peoples_army_desc:0 "The People's Army prioritizes the power of human resolve over advanced weaponry, relying on motivation to offset technological limitations. This approach enjoys broad support from the civilian population.\n\n"
r56_tactical_withdrawal:0 "Tactical Withdrawal"
r56_tactical_withdrawal_desc:0 "Recognizing the potential for encirclement and implementing timely withdrawals can prevent the destruction of a significant portion of our forces."

r56_prepared_defense_desc:0 "Extensive field fortifications greatly enhance a unit's defense, providing improved protection and strategic control over the battlefield."
R56_LAST_STAND_LABEL:0 "LAST STAND"
R56_LAST_STAND_LABEL_TT:0 "§WWe dig in, united and unwavering, making our final stand, for we are a force that refuses to be broken.§!"
r56_pocket_defence:0 "Pocket Defense"
r56_pocket_defence_desc:0 "In a defensive scenario, there is a possibility that our troops may become trapped in a pocket. In such a situation, their primary objective is to hold their ground until the inevitable counter-attack comes to their rescue and relieves them."
r56_last_stand:0 "Last Stand"
r56_last_stand_desc:0 "When all avenues of retreat have been exhausted, one must firmly entrench themselves and bravely face the ultimate challenge, making their unwavering final stand."
R56_BREAKOUT_LABEL:0 "BREAKOUT"
R56_BREAKOUT_LABEL_TT:0 "§WWhen the enemy finally exhausts themselves on our defense, we can plan a counter-attack and breakout.§!"
r56_breakout:0 "Breakout"
r56_breakout_desc:0 "§WOnce the enemy has expended their resources and energy, we can strategically devise a counter-attack plan and execute a breakout from our fortified defense.§!"
r56_breakthrough_priority:0 "Breakthrough Priority"
r56_breakthrough_priority_desc:0 "The imperative of concentrating forces for Breakthroughs takes precedence over all front-line requirements. Local defeats pale in significance when weighed against the opportunity to deliver a decisive and impactful blow."
r56_operational_concentration:0 "Local Offensive Concentration"
r56_operational_concentration_desc:0 "Achieving overwhelming local superiority is paramount in any military action. Unless complete superiority can be achieved across the entire front, it necessitates the deliberate weakening of certain segments of the front line and concentrate where they are most needed."
