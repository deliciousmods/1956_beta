r56_guerilla_warfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
r56_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "We need to change how our armed forces operate. The fact of the matter is that the armies that we'd possibly go to war with greatly outmatch us. We need to adopt an asymmetrical approach to warfare if we ever hope to stand a chance."
r56_double_envelopment:0 "Sudden Envelopment"
r56_double_envelopment_desc:0 "While a Envelopment is a military tactic as old as warfare itself. We can utilize this basic tactic when the enemy overextends its forces, and we have superior knowledge of the terrain. We can then quickly envelop a small number of enemy troops and destroy them before the enemy can aid the trapped troops or even know they're in trouble! We can than repeat this process to cut large enemy forces into more manageable ones."

r56_infiltration_assault:0 "Infiltration Assault"
r56_infiltration_assault_desc:0 "In the opening moves of an attack, infantry must target weak points in the enemy line to bypass and isolate the more well-defended sections, which the rest of the attacking forces can then wipe out."
r56_infiltration_in_depth:0 "Deep Infiltration"
r56_infiltration_in_depth_desc:0 "Our forces are now trained to bypass and isolate enemy strongpoints to a much greater depth. Ideally, our assault forces should not stop until they reach the enemy's rear areas and their forces are entirely cut off."
r56_backhand_blow:0 "Backhand Blow"
r56_backhand_blow_desc:0 "Rather than fighting for every inch of ground, enemy penetrations are largely avoided until they have extended themselves, at which point they can be cut off and destroyed by counterattacks."

r56_pocket_defence:0 "Pocket Defense"
r56_pocket_defence_desc:0 "It is possible that, on the defensive, our troops may be caught in a pocket. In this case, they must merely hold out until the inevitable counter-attack relieves them."

r56_breakthrough_priority_desc:0 "All needs of the front are subordinated to the need to concentrate forces for Breakthroughs. Local defeats are inconsequential compared to striking a decisive blow."
r56_operational_concentration:0 "Local Offensive Concentration"
r56_operational_concentration_desc:0 "The key to any military action is overwhelming local superiority. Short of being overwhelmingly superior along the entire front, this involves weakening parts of your front line to concentrate troops where needed rather than trying to be strong everywhere."
