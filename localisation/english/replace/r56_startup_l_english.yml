 r56.startup.event.01.description: "Hello and Greetings from the 56 Team!\n\nThe mod will automatically switch to Multiplayer Mode if at least two countries are player-controlled. This mode disables a few unbalanced things and has some AI performance tweaks.\n\n§R--- IMPORTANT ---\n§!This mod officially updates every month around the 7th/8th. We recommend that you finish your games and campaigns before those dates since our updates can occasionally break save games. Thanks for your understanding. Additionally, keep in mind that new expansion/update releases usually delay our updates.\n\nAlso, if you encounter any bugs or issues, ensure that you don't have any mod conflicts; otherwise, please report them in a detailed manner on our Discord."
