 USA_mechanized_equipment_x_desc:0 "Taking experience from the field usage of the converted armored personnel carriers (APCs) from knocked-out tanks by the Canadians, the US Army was reluctant on the idea of using a fully-tracked, fully-enclosed, dedicated APCs that was limited in capacity and versatility. Conversely, the fully covered APC with a hard top addressed the issue of infantry being exposed to shrapnel and air-burst artillery shells."

The USMC was enthusiastic about the idea of an amphibious craft, so designs for a militarized variant of the craft were quickly made. Capable of ferrying 24 fully equipped men or 4,500 pounds (2,000 kg) of cargo, the LVT-2 was armed with two .30 caliber machine guns to provide light fire support."
