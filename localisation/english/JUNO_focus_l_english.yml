 SMB_air_defense_default: "Air Defense"
 SMB_air_defense_default_desc: "Now that our rivals have shown their true colors and started developing their own aerial weapons, we must prepare our response. As such, we should start by ordering the rapid construction and deployment of anti air emplacements and guns." 
 SMB_air_force_default: "Arm the Fuerzas Aéreas"
 SMB_air_force_default_desc: "Many theorists would argue that the area we are currently falling behind in most is the development of a modern air force. Therefore, we must work hard to remedy this, by constructing new hangar and facilities, as well as training additional pilots."
 SMB_air_academy_default: "Establish a Proper Air Academy"
 SMB_air_academy_default_desc: "It is not only the soldiers who will fight in the ground forces who need to be properly taught. Our pilots, though enthusiastic, lack the professional training they need to excel in dogfights. To solve this, we should expand the military academy to include more classes catering to the air force."
 SMB_construct_air_bases_default: "Construct New Air Bases"
 SMB_construct_air_bases_default_desc: "Besides needing professional and well educated and motivated pilots, we also lack another critical function required for a large air force, airfields. Though we have a few, they are not enough for if we wish to expand the air force to a level where it can become competitive."
 SMB_domestic_designs_default: "Domestic Designs"
 SMB_domestic_designs_default_desc: "It would be best to create and produce our own models and plane designs, as other countries cannot be deemed trustworthy of either designing or producing airplanes fit for our pilots."
 SMB_license_designs_default: "License Foreign Designs"

 SMB_tactical_air_force_default: "A Tactical Air Force"
 SMB_tactical_air_force_default_desc: "The air force should be used to not only support the ground forces, but to perform a multitude of more complex tasks, ones which the ground forces alone cannot do. That is the true essence of what makes an air force great."
 SMB_nimble_air_force_default: "A Nimble Air Force"
 SMB_nimble_air_force_default_desc: "Planes should be able to outmaneuver not only the enemy planes, but also the watching eyes of their anti air guns and naval vessels.

 SMB_air_modifier_boost_2_default_desc: "If we wish for our planes to survive contact with the enemy, it is important that they are not only able to avoid as many hits as possible, but that they can also survive a hit or two, and reach as far as they need to go to get back for repairs. That is why we should develop better frames and engines for our planes, so that the pilots can be safe, no matter what."
 SMB_air_doctrine_default: "Doctrinal Advancements"
 SMB_air_doctrine_default_desc: "It is important to note that without a proper strategy, not even the greatest pilots and planes can thrive in battle.

 SMB_tierra_del_fuego_training: "Train on Tierra del Fuego"
 SMB_tierra_del_fuego_training_desc: "Our soldiers need to be properly trained if we wish for them to fight effectively in the cold south and in the mountains.

 SMB_a_land_of_mountains_desc: "[ROOT.GetName] has long had a strong tradition of utilizing the mountainous terrain to its advantage when fighting, and the future will be no different. We are a people used to living in the mountains, and we will use our expertise to defeat any juggernaut we come up against."

 SMB_navy_desc: "[SMB_navy_desc_key]"
 SMB_navy_desc_default: "Our navy has stagnated since the Great War to such an extent that many of our vessels are no longer fit for purpose. It is time we invested in the fleet and begin a massive modernization program."
 SMB_CHL_navy_desc: "While our fleet has a long and proud tradition, the Navy's prestige was badly damaged by the naval mutiny of 1931. By investing in the Armada de Chile we can help rebuild public confidence in our Navy."
 SMB_naval_academy_desc: "[SMB_naval_academy_desc_key]" 
 SMB_naval_academy_default_desc: "Simply producing and maintaining ships is not enough to constitute a navy. We require officers and specialists who are highly trained in how to utilize naval assets in a battle. Therefore, we shall establish a [ROOT.GetAdjective] naval academy to train the next generation of naval officers."
 SMB_naval_academy_CHL_desc: "Our Escuela Naval has a long history of training skilled naval officers, but continued investment is vital to ensuring our admirals and captains are prepared for modern naval warfare."
 SMB_construct_naval_bases_desc: "Our naval facilities are antiquated and in desperate need of modernization. By investing in such facilities, we will be able to construct and support much more capable naval assets."
 SMB_naval_foreign_advisors_desc: "Our naval officers have had little opportunity to test their capabilities in battle recently. We could therefore benefit from inviting officers from foreign navies to train our own officers in modern naval tactics."
 SMB_reescalate_the_naval_arms_race_desc: "While we have no formal agreement with our neighbors over the size of our navies, we have refrained from expanding them too much since the Great War.

 SMB_blue_water_fleet_desc: "Projection of naval power is critical to any nation that aspires to join the ranks of the great powers or to maintain a strong deterrent against would-be foes. We should therefore ensure our navy has the right equipment and training to operate effectively even when far from home ports."

 SMB_purchase_cruisers_and_dreadnoughts_desc: "While our industrial strength continues to grow, time is not on our side. In order to adequately strengthen our navy, we need more capital ships as soon as possible. Therefore, we shall reach out to the great powers to see if they are willing to sell their mothballed dreadnoughts and cruisers."
 SMB_minelaying_desc: "Maintaining enough ships to defend our vast coastline at all times can be prohibitively expensive. Mines offer a cheaper solution that can help deter or slow down enemy forces until the fleet arrives."
 SMB_escort_fleet_desc: "The days of grand battle fleets are over, modern naval warfare requires fleets of smaller vessels in escort formations alongside a limited number of capital ships. The navy therefore needs to reorientate their plans to accommodate such tactics. "
 SMB_raiding_fleet_desc: "Naval supply lines are crucial to the functioning of most economies. Using our naval assets to disrupt those supply lines could be a way to bring even the most powerful nations to their knees."
 SMB_degaussing_desc: "We will start to degauss our ship hulls, reducing their magnetic signature. This protects them from magnetic mines and reduces the ships’ electronic profile."
 SMB_naval_invasion_desc: "Dealing with an enemy nation often requires soldiers landing on their shores. In order to maximize our ability to carry out such operations, we shall begin training the army and navy in joint exercises. "

 SMB_expand_repair_yards_desc: "Even the most robust ships with the most efficient crews will eventually need repairs before returning to active duty. We should invest in our naval repair yards to ensure the process is as rapid as possible. "
 SMB_enlarge_naval_facilities_desc: "Recent developments across the globe have it clear that our navy must expand if we are to maintain an adequate fleet. The first step towards doing so is expanding our existing naval facilities."
 SMB_merchant_marine_desc: "The transport of resources over sea is vital to the national security of many nations, ours being no exception. Therefore, we should establish a professional merchant marine fleet capable of supporting our military in times of crisis."
 SMB_aircraft_carriers_desc: "To avoid being left behind by our foes, we need to incorporate aircraft into our navy. In order to do so, we need to produce aircraft carriers of our own. Utilizing the hulls of our larger, outdated ships may be a way to accelerate production of them."
