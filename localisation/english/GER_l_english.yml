Although Oberschlesien is less industrially developed than Gdynia and would relinquish our sea access there, we  would gain access to steel and aluminium resources in the region and would much improve our relations with the German government alongside growing our population and easing ethnic tensions in both regions."

 r56.ger.60.t:0 "Election Day!"
 r56.ger.60.desc:0 "A democratic country needs its elections to function, today these elections will be held and the winner will lead the government and therefore get the position of president.\n\nThere are two major parties that have a shot at winning the elections. By far the most popular party is the SPD which has had considerable influence over [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] politics for most of its existance. They represent social democratic viewpoints, favouring the lower classes of workers by strengthening trade unions and establishing a socialsytem.\nTheir main competitor is Zentrum, the somewhat older and more centrist party of the two. Their main voters are catholics from south germany. The party is more conservative in their cultural and economic policies, yet it does not shy away from increasing benefits for workers.\n\nNow, all votes have been counted and the results are as follows:"
 r56.ger.60.a:0 "Zentrum wins decisively!"
 r56.ger.60.b:0 "SPD wins decisively!"
 r56.ger.60.c:0 "Zentrum wins narrowly and forms a coalition."
 r56.ger.60.d:0 "SPD wins narrowly and forms a coalition."
 r56.ger.60.e:0 "The current government gets another uncontested 4 years!"

 r56.ger.61.t:0 "Otto Wels Dies aged 66"
 r56.ger.61.desc:0 "Otto Wels, one of the last bastions to fall to fascism, has finally passed away at the age of 66. He has been the chairman of the SPD for 20 years, and ruling the country ever since the fall of fascism in the civil war.\n\nOne cannot overstate the importance of this personality in [ROOT.GetAdjectiveCap] politics. There will be few people that will be able to live up to his legacy. His sucessor, Hans Vogel, will lead the country from now on. Let us hope that he will have a presidency that matches that of Wels.\n\nOtto Wels will be laid to rest in the next couple of days as the country still mourns his loss. His gravestone will be inscribed with a quote from his final speech in 1933, before the enabling act was brought into law:"
 r56.ger.61.a:0 ""You may take our freedom and life, but you can never take our dignity!""

 r56.ger.63.t:0 "Hans Vogel Dies aged 58"
 r56.ger.63.desc:0 "The President is dead. He died peacefully in his sleep at age 58. Altough relatively young, he has had a fulfilling life, dedicated to Germany and its prosperity.\n\nHe has been politically active in trade unions from a young age and a staple in German politics for several decades. He became co-chairman of the SPD, together with Otto Wels and Arthur Crispien in 1931. After Wels' death in 1939, he became president himself, leading Germany into a bright future.\n\nHis sucessor, Kurt Schumacher, will officially become President in the next couple of days, as the nation's former President gets buried in a graveyard in Berlin."
 r56.ger.63.a:0 "Rest in Peace! Schumacher will be a worthy successor."
