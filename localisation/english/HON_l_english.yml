HON_herrera_jailbreak:0 "Break Herrera Out of Prison"
HON_herrera_jailbreak_desc:0 "Manuel Calis Herrera was the founder of the Bloque Obrero Campesino and its only presidential candidate.

HON_peasant_revolution_desc:0 "The campesinos are restless, and most of them have joined the BOC. Carias's power base has eroded, and the time is ripe for revolution.

HON_peoples_army_desc:0 "Even though the people now have control of the country, the success of our revolution isn't guaranteed.

HON_liberal_amnesty_desc:0 "Even though the Communist Party is outlawed, President Carias is willing to accept some opposition from the Liberal Party.

HON_fortifications:0 "Defend the Nation"
HON_fortifications_desc:0 "Honduras is likely to remain neutral in the upcoming war, but it would be prudent to improve our defenses. [GER.GetNameDefCap] or [JAP.GetNameDef] might attempt to use our country as a base for invading [USA.GetNameDef], but building a few forts should deter them."

HON_carias_legacy:0 "President Carias's Legacy"
HON_carias_legacy_desc:0 "Historians will not be able to evaluate Tiburcio Carias Andino's legacy easily. While he suppressed most forms of political opposition and fought against [HON.GetAdjective] labor unions, he provided stability to the [HON.GetAdjective] economy during the Great Depression.

HON_suggest_monarchy_desc:0 "Our country has been declining since our independence from Spain, and a few voices on the fringe suggest that Honduras attempt to revive the Viceroyalty of New Spain.

HON_invite_juan_desc:0 "While Infante Juan hoped to succeed his father as the king of Spain, recent events have taught him that his coronation will be unlikely. Let's offer him the throne of Honduras and the prospect of restoring the Viceroyalty of New Spain."
HON_monarchist_coup:0 "Monarchist Coup"
HON_monarchist_coup_desc:0 "Now that Infante Juan has returned from Spain, let's topple President Carias. We can coronate Infante Juan as Juan I and begin preparations to restore the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Our new king is now the only Juan that can restore the viceroyalty to its former glory."

HON_reclaim_salvador:0 "Reclaim El Salvador"

HON_reclaim_belize_desc:0 "Perfidious Albion took Belize from the Spanish when they allowed pirates to settle in Baymen and fully recognized Belize as a colony in 1786. The Spanish crown attempted to retake Belize during the Battle of St. George's Caye in 1798 but failed due to British trickery. However, the [ENG.GetADjective] seem preoccupied with their current war, and now might be an ideal time for us to reclaim Belize."

HON_reclaim_hispanola_desc:0 "Hispanola was once entirely owned by the Spanish Empire, but it lost control of the western half to France in the 17th century and control of the eastern half in 1795 to independence in the Peace of Basel.

HON_refined_goods:0 "Industrial Agriculture"
HON_refined_goods_desc:0 "Spain's lack of industrialization was one of the causes of its downfall, and we do not want to make the same mistake.

HON_economica:0 "Sponsor the Economic Society"
HON_economica_desc:0 "The Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais, or Economic Society of Friends of the Country, were private associations founded in various cities in the Spanish Empire.

HON_reclaim_america:0 "Reconquer the Northern Territories"
HON_reclaim_america_desc:0 "The Spanish-speaking world has been consistently humiliated by the Anglos since they sank the Spanish armada hundreds of years ago.

HON_reclaim_spain:0 "Take Back the Spanish Throne"
HON_reclaim_spain_desc:0 "Now that Juan I has complete control over New Spain, he can plan his return to Spain. Crossing the Atlantic will not be easy, but that didn't stop the conquistadors. Returning Spain to its monarchical roots will allow us to restore the empire to its former glory."
HON_gran_colombia:0 "Prepare to Liberate Gran Colombia"
HON_gran_colombia_desc:0 "Gran Colombia has been divided since the death of Simon Bolivar, and this division has allowed the Yankee bourgeoise to take advantage of our Colombian comrades.

HON_liberate_brazil:0 "Free Brazil"
HON_liberate_brazil_desc:0 "Even though Brazil's 1930 weakened Brazil's oligarchs, the farmers in this country are still oppressed by the military and the urban bourgeoisie. We must overthrow this oppressive regime and replace it with one with the people's interests at heart."
HON_caribfed:0 "Initiate the Caribbean Revolution"
HON_caribfed_desc:0 "European imperialists have dominated the islands of the Caribbean for hundreds of years, and most of the people in this region have never experienced true sovereignty. We must liberate the farmers in the Caribbean and unite them under one banner.

HON_fullcaribfed:0 "Spread the Revolution to Hispanola"

HON_liblaplata:0 "Unify La Plata"
HON_liblaplata_desc:0 "Our comrades in Argentina support our proposal of reunifying La Plata, and they are eager to help us liberate the rest of South America.
