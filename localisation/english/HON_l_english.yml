HON_go_communist_desc:0 "The Bloque Obrero Campesino, or Peasant Worker Block, was founded by Manuel Calix Herrera in the late 1920s, but Carias banned it when he became president.

HON_herrera_jailbreak:0 "Break Herrera Out of Prison"
HON_herrera_jailbreak_desc:0 "Manuel Calis Herrera was the founder of the Bloque Obrero Campesino and its only presidential candidate.

HON_soviet_support:0 "Seek [SOV.GetAdjective] Assistance"

HON_peasant_revolution_desc:0 "The campesinos are restless, and most of them have joined the BOC. Carias's power base has eroded, and the time is ripe for revolution.

HON_peoples_army_desc:0 "Even though the people now have control of the country, the success of our revolution isn't guaranteed.

HON_liberal_amnesty_desc:0 "Even though the Communist Party is outlawed, President Carias is willing to accept some opposition from the Liberal Party.

HON_fortifications:0 "Defend the Nation"
HON_fortifications_desc:0 "Honduras is likely to remain neutral in the upcoming war, but it would be prudent to improve our defenses. [GER.GetNameDefCap] or [JAP.GetNameDef] might attempt to use our country as a base for invading [USA.GetNameDef], but building a few forts should deter them."

HON_carias_legacy:0 "President Carias's Legacy"
HON_carias_legacy_desc:0 "Historians will not be able to evaluate Tiburcio Carias Andino's legacy easily. While he suppressed most forms of political opposition and fought against [HON.GetAdjective] labor unions, he provided stability to the [HON.GetAdjective] economy during the Great Depression.

HON_examine_industry:0 "The [HON.GetAdjective] Economy"

HON_build_infra2:0 "Connect the Nation"

HON_improved_research:0 "Improved Research Methods"

HON_suggest_monarchy_desc:0 "Our country has been declining since our independence from Spain, and a few voices on the fringe suggest that Honduras attempt to revive the Viceroyalty of New Spain.

HON_haciendas:0 "Restore the Hacienda System"
HON_haciendas_desc:0 "Many international companies in [HON.GetNameDef] have established their plantations as de facto haciendas.

HON_restoration_wars:0 "The Restoration Wars"
HON_restoration_wars_desc:0 "We will need to reconquer the majority of the land that constituted the Viceroyalty of New Spain before we can proclaim this state's restoration. Restoring the viceroyalty's 1820 borders will be our first step on our return to imperial glory."
HON_reclaim_salvador:0 "Reclaim El Salvador"

HON_reclaim_belize_desc:0 "Perfidious Albion took Belize from the Spanish when they allowed pirates to settle in Baymen and fully recognized Belize as a colony in 1786. The Spanish crown attempted to retake Belize during the Battle of St. George's Caye in 1798 but failed due to British trickery. However, the [ENG.GetADjective] seem preoccupied with their current war, and now might be an ideal time for us to reclaim Belize."
HON_reclaim_costarica:0 "Reclaim Costa Rica"
HON_reclaim_costarica_desc:0 "Costa Rica was the southern frontier of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and it is an integral part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Even though this land is not particularly valuable, we must take Costa Rica to secure our southern border."
HON_reclaim_cuba:0 "Reclaim Cuba"
HON_reclaim_cuba_desc:0 "Cuba was one of the few territories that stayed loyal to Spain in the revolutionary wars, but the Americans took it during the Spanish-American War.

HON_reclaim_hispanola_desc:0 "Hispaniola was once entirely owned by the Spanish Empire, but it lost control of the western half to France in the 17th century and control of the eastern half in 1795 to independence in the Peace of Basel.

HON_intendancies:0 "Reintroduce the Intendancies"

HON_refined_goods:0 "Industrial Agriculture"
HON_refined_goods_desc:0 "Spain's lack of industrialization was one of the causes of its downfall, and we do not want to make the same mistake.

HON_economica:0 "Sponsor the Economic Society"
HON_economica_desc:0 "The Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais, or Economic Society of Friends of the Country, were private associations founded in various cities in the Spanish Empire.

HON_inquisition:0 "The New Spanish Inquisition"
HON_inquisition_desc:0 "The Spanish Inquisition was one of the Spanish Empire's most powerful tools, and they were instrumental in ensuring our subjects' loyalty to the empire and the Catholic faith.

HON_proclaim_new_spain_desc:0 "Many thought that our king was insane when he said that he would reunite the Viceroyalty of New Spain under his rule, but he has succeeded.

HON_reclaim_america:0 "Reconquer the Northern Territories"
HON_reclaim_america_desc:0 "The Spanish-speaking world has been consistently humiliated by the Anglos since they sank the Spanish armada hundreds of years ago.

HON_reclaim_spain:0 "Take Back the Spanish Throne"
HON_reclaim_spain_desc:0 "Now that Juan I has complete control over New Spain, he can plan his return to Spain. Crossing the Atlantic will not be easy, but that didn't stop the conquistadors. Returning Spain to its monarchical roots will allow us to restore the empire to its former glory."

HON_gran_colombia_desc:0 "Gran Colombia has been divided since the death of Simon Bolivar, and this division has allowed the Yankee bourgeoise to take advantage of our Colombian comrades.

HON_liberate_brazil:0 "Free Brazil"
HON_liberate_brazil_desc:0 "Even though Brazil's 1930 weakened Brazil's oligarchs, the farmers in this country are still oppressed by the military and the urban bourgeoisie. We must overthrow this oppressive regime and replace it with one with the people's interests at heart."
HON_caribfed:0 "Initiate the Caribbean Revolution"
HON_caribfed_desc:0 "European imperialists have dominated the islands of the Caribbean for hundreds of years, and most of the people in this region have never experienced true sovereignty. We must liberate the farmers in the Caribbean and unite them under one banner. Since the Cubans were betrayed by the gringo imperialists in their last revolution, they would probably be amenable to being the center of the new Caribbean Revolution."
HON_fullcaribfed:0 "Spread the Revolution to Hispaniola"

HON_libargent_desc:0 "Now that most of Latin America has been liberated, we can turn our attention to the southernmost end of Latin America. We could create a new republic of La Plata, run by the campesinos. However, we should establish a friendly government in Argentina before attempting to reunite La Plata."
HON_liblaplata:0 "Unify La Plata"
HON_liblaplata_desc:0 "Our comrades in Argentina support our proposal of reunifying La Plata, and they are eager to help us liberate the rest of South America.
