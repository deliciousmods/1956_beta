 CHL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Chile's recent history has been marked by government coups, civil strife, and political strongmen. However, there is hope within many political circles in Chile that the country can return to democracy and political stability. This task is not easy for the democratic coalition who dub themselves the 'Popular Front.' The coalition's rivals include Chile's current leader and dictator, Arturo Alessandri. Who wishes nothing but to see the coalition's demise. Radical trade unions seek to hijack the 'Popular Front' and take it in a Marxist direction. At the same time, the Nacista's fascist movement gains more sympathizers by the day."

It seems we've severely underestimated their movement's strength, as many former military officers and some of our current junior officers have joined their cause. They have currently seized the capital of Santiago and the surrounding areas. They've also overrun the police force and local garrisons, taking military equipment in the process. It seems we need to rally the military and anti-fascist forces to crush this uprising.\n\nUnfortunately, the fighting between our two forces has escalated in the last twenty-four hours into a total civil war."

 CHL_artillery_f:0 "Artillery Effort"
 CHL_artillery_f_desc:0 "Our strategy is centered around bombarding the enemy as much as possible until they submit. As such, it is only natural that we develop new models of artillery to bombard our opponents more accurately and more devastatingly."
 CHL_support:0 "Support Effort"
 CHL_support_desc:0 "Infantry alone is ineffective. Not only does infantry require ordinance support but logistical, reconnaissance, and specialist support. We should not allow these elements of our army to lag."
 CHL_rockets:0 "Rocketry"
 CHL_rockets_desc:0 "Our researchers have come to us with an exciting proposition: rockets. They say that the future of artillery lies in their exploitation. Indeed, we are not the type to turn down an opportunity for an even more effective way of bombarding our foes. We should investigate these rockets and see if they are worthwhile."
 CHL_naval_doctrine:0 "Naval Doctrine Advancement"

 CHL_nationalise_all:0 "Nationalize All Industry"
 CHL_nationalise_all_desc:0 "For too long have the bourgeois grown fat off the commoners' labor. No longer shall we tolerate indolent overseers and tyrannical taskmasters.

 CHL_communist_faction_desc:0 "The Comintern mocks true communism - they are not even socialists. Stalin is no more than a despotic tzar ruling through fear. We should establish our faction of truly communist states and propagate our revolution."

 CHL_trade_deals:0 "New Trade Deals"
 CHL_trade_deals_desc:0 "[CHL.GetNameDefCap] is too closely linked with [GER.GetNameDef] and the other fascist ilk for prosperity. We should pursue new trade opportunities with the other democracies of the world."
 CHL_expand_private_sector:0 "Expand the Private Sector"
 CHL_expand_private_sector_desc:0 "Far too much of the [CHL.GetAdjective] economy is publicly owned. We should reduce the government's involvement to increase competition and efficiency. Both the people and the economy shall benefit from this."

 CHL_expand_alliance_desc:0 "We should expand our alliance to our neighbors to strengthen ourselves and protect them from any warmongering neighbors. [URG.GetNameDefCap] is of strategic importance in the Atlantic region but cannot defend itself. We should offer for them to join us."

 CHL_paraguayan_threat_desc:0 "[PAR.GetNameDefCap] cannot be allowed to remain on our border. They propose a communist regime that threatens the delicate balance of South America. If we do not act soon, they may send agents against us first."
 CHL_establish_the_airforce:0 "Invest in Linea Aérea Nacional"
 CHL_establish_the_airforce_desc:0 "Linea Aérea Nacional was established in 1932 under Carlos Ibáñez del Campo but, as yet, it is only a small fleet. The skies will prove a necessary battlefield and, as such, aircraft an essential investment.

 CHL_bomber_focus_2:0 "Tactical Bombers"

 CHL_heavy_fighter_focus:0 "Heavy Fighters"
 CHL_heavy_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Enemy bombers accost [CHL.GetNameDef] like a swarm of wasps. Heavy fighters will be ideal for eradicating them and will help maintain air superiority in the remote and distant areas of South America."

 CHL_jet_focus:0 "Jet Effort"
 CHL_jet_focus_desc:0 "The universities tell us of new forms of engine: jet engines. They say these engines would allow for a new breed of aircraft far more robust than any of those which have come before it. These sound like bold claims, but the prospect is too enticing to ignore."

 CHL_german_ties:0 "Request Advisors from [GER.GetNameDef]"
 CHL_german_ties_desc:0 "The [GER.GetAdjective] army is very advanced, far beyond our military, and we could learn much from them. Since we align ideologically, we should appeal to them for assistance."
 CHL_japan_accord:0 "Accord with [JAP.GetNameDef]"
 CHL_japan_accord_desc:0 "Chile has long been a significant naval power in the pacific. The [JAP.GetAdjective] have become a powerful force in the region of late.

 CHL_fascist_constitution:0 "Redraft the Constitution"

 CHL_extirpation_desc:0 "Long has Chile been accosted by dubious characters. The [CHL.GetAdjective] people are of the highest character and form. We must remove those who fall short of our expectations and appropriate their resources for the moral and physical health of the nation."
 CHL_communist_conquest:0 "Liberate South America"

 CHL_japan_faction:0 "An Alliance with [JAP.GetNameDef]"
 CHL_japan_faction_desc:0 "Having agreed to share the Pacific with [JAP.GetNameDef], we should formalize an alliance to help secure it between us. [USA.GetNameDef] will be pushed back where it belongs, and we shall once more rule this ocean."

 CHL_support_peronism:0 "Support Peronism in [ARG.GetNameDef]"
 CHL_support_peronism_desc:0 "A grassroots populist movement is emerging in [ARG.GetNameDef] and could become a close friend. While Peron may not share our views on the Semitic community and the character of our people, he is still a populist and nationalist."

 CHL_support_argentinian_coup_desc:0 "The Peronists have broad popular support within [ARG.GetNameDef], but the government will not let them take over. We should support a putsch in Argentina to secure their rule."

 CHL_expand_alliance_pru:0 "Return Arica to [PRU.GetNameDef]"
 CHL_expand_alliance_pru_desc:0 "Arica was part of the Peruvian province of Tarapacá until 1883, when we conquered it following the War of the Pacific. Since then, we have returned Tacna in 1929 at the behest of America to preserve peace but not Arica. These solutions have only been temporary, and the only way to ensure stability is to return what is not ours."
