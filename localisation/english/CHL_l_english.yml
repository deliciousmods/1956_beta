 CHL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Chile's recent history has been marked by government coups, civil strife, and political strongmen. However, there is hope within many political circles in Chile that the country can return to democracy and political stability. This task is not easy for the democratic coalition who dub themselves the 'Popular Front.' The coalition's rivals include Chile's current leader and dictator, Arturo Alessandri. Who wishes nothing but to see the coalition's demise. Radical trade unions seek to hijack the 'Popular Front' and take it in a Marxist direction. At the same time, the Nacista's fascist movement gains more sympathizers by the day."

 chile.39.d:0 "Following the recent political events within the country, the Nacistas have grown more upset with the current government. This sentiment seems to have materialized, as this morning, a small number of militant fascists led by Jorge González von Marées tried to topple our government in a coup.\n\nLuckily their movement hasn't gained any steam, and the current number of Nacistas rebels is assumed to be very small. They are currently held up in a couple of government buildings in Santiago.\n\nThough they've overrun the local police force, a formal military response should crush them."

This sentiment seems to have materialized, as this morning, a large number of militant fascists led by Jorge González von Marées tried to topple our government in a coup.\n\nWe've managed to secure our military in the north and are preparing a response. It seems we've severely underestimated their movement's strength, as many former military officers and some of our current junior officers have joined their cause. They have currently seized the capital of Santiago and the surrounding areas. They've also overrun the police force and local garrisons, taking military equipment in the process. It seems we need to rally the military and anti-fascist forces to crush this uprising.\n\nUnfortunately, the fighting between our two forces has escalated in the last twenty-four hours into a total civil war."

 CHL_support_argentinian_coup_desc:0 "The Peronists have broad popular support within [ARG.GetNameDef], but the government will not let them take over. We should support a putsch in Argentina to secure their rule."
