 DEN_Industrial_Focus_Sjaelland_desc:0 "In the event of a [GER.GetAdjective] invasion, we may be forced to retreat to our two islands, Fyn and Sjaelland. Building factories here will ensure that they do not fall into [GER.GetAdjective] hands, even though the islands lack the same amount of space as Jutland."

 DEN_Industrial_Focus_Jutland:0 "Industry in Jutland"

 DEN_Fortify_Sjaelland_desc:0 "It is hopeless to defend Jutland against the numerically superior [GER.GetAdjective] forces. Sjaelland and Funen, on the other hand, might stand a chance.

 DEN_AA_Jutland:0 "Jutland Anti-Air Effort"
 DEN_AA_Jutland_desc:0 "We can build all the forts we want, but even the most extensive fortifications will not withstand heavy bombing from the air. If we up our anti-air defenses, we stand a better chance. It will also reduce the effect of strategic bombing on our factories."

 DEN_AA_Sjaelland:0 "Sjaelland Anti-Air Effort"
 DEN_AA_Sjaelland_desc:0 "Now that we have concentrated parts of our industry in Sjaelland, we should prepare for an eventual bombing campaign. If we build heavy AA emplacements all around Copenhagen, we can better withstand a [GER.GetAdjective] threat to bomb our capital. It has the added benefit of giving our people a sense of security."

 DEN_Danish_Steel:0 "Found the Danish Steel Rolling Mill"
 DEN_Danish_Steel_desc:0 "The Danish Steel Rolling Mill, in Danish 'Det Danske Stålvalseværk', was founded in Frederiksværk, a town in Sjaelland. This vast steel mill will deliver a significant portion of the steel our country needs, and understandably, representatives from our dockyards, including A.P. Møller, are heavily investing in this plant."
 DEN_Danish_Steel_short_desc:0 "Found the Danish Steel Rolling Mill"
 DEN_Armament_Effort:0 "Expand Our Arms Factories"
 DEN_Armament_Effort_desc:0 "If we need to prepare for war, we must build more factories that produce arms. We might also learn a thing or two about production efficiency while we are at it."

 DEN_DISA:0 "Expand DISA"
 DEN_DISA_desc:0 "DISA, an arms manufacturer known in Danish as 'Dansk Industri Syndikat A/S', has existed for several decades and produces certain very successful weapons, such as the Madsen machinegun, which even the [GER.GetAdjective]s, [ITA.GetAdjective]s, [SOV.GetAdjective]s, and the [JAP.GetAdjective] use. This company is capable of innovation and production; expanding it will undoubtedly result in more military innovations."

 DEN_Naval_Effort:0 "Expand the Orlogsværft"
 DEN_Naval_Effort_desc:0 "If we intend to expand our production of vessels for the Royal [DEN.GetAdjective] Navy, we must expand our shipbuilding facilities. The 400-year-old shipyard in Copenhagen, known as the Orlogsværft, has been serving us faithfully and will continue to do so."
 DEN_Naval_Effort_short_desc:0 "Expand the Orlogsværft"
 DEN_Naval_Effort_2:0 "Expand Odense Staalskibsværft"
 DEN_Naval_Effort_2_desc:0 "Shipping magnate A.P. Møller owns a mediocre-sized civilian shipyard near Odense. If we help him expand his shipyard, we could build some of our ships there."

 DISA_idea:0 "Dansk Industri Syndikat"
 DISA_idea_desc:0 "The Danish Industry Syndicate was initially formed as the Danish Rifle Syndicate to produce the immensely popular Madsen machinegun. We have expanded DISA with new factories and larger R&D divisions, giving us increased abilities to research and produce infantry weapons and support artillery."
 DEN_Staff:0 "[DEN.GetAdjective] General Staff"
 DEN_Staff_desc:0 "We have expanded our general staff and selected the most qualified candidates for promotions. This has paid off, as our army has been strengthened and our ability to plan our moves in great detail increased."
 DEN_Infra:0 "[DEN.GetAdjective] Autobahn"
 DEN_Infra_desc:0 "Our [GER.GetADjective] neighbors have built a large highway that allows quick transport of military equipment and soldiers. They call it the Reichsautobahn. Perhaps we could build a similar highway in [DEN.GetNameDef]?"
 DEN_Infra_short_desc:0 "Build infrastructure in [DEN.GetNameDef]"
 DEN_Gen_Staff:0 "Expand the General Staff"
 DEN_Gen_Staff_desc: "Like the [Ger.GetAdjective], we have our general staff, the Generalstab.

This has the benefit of allowing our generals to develop new doctrines much more quickly."
 DEN_Gen_Staff_short_desc:0 "Expand the Generalstab"
 DEN_SOK:0 "Create the SOK"
 DEN_SOK_desc:0 "The navy has long been neglected under the Social Democratic government of Thorvald Stauning. This has recently changed, with the expansion of the shipyards in Odense and Copenhagen. To match our naval expansion, we must also expand our general staff for our navy. We should form Søværnets Operative Kommando, the SOK. This might help us develop more advanced naval doctrines as well."
 DEN_SOK_short_desc:0 "Create the SOK"
 DEN_Cruiser_Focus:0 "Cruiser Effort"
 DEN_Cruiser_Focus_desc:0 "To defend our waters, we must build a sizable navy consisting of cruisers and destroyers."

 DEN_Submarine_Focus:0 "Submarine Effort"
 DEN_Submarine_Focus_desc:0 "We have naval bases in the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland. These bases can be used as staging bases for submarine wolfpacks. If we follow through on this idea and build a large submarine navy, it will act as a deterrent towards any nation that considers invading us."
 DEN_Submarine_Focus_short_desc:0 "Submarine Effort"
 DEN_Cruiser_Doctrine:0 "Develop Cruiser Doctrines"
 DEN_Cruiser_Doctrine_desc:0 "While we can certainly expand our naval capabilities, we will never be able to rival the major European naval powers in size. As such, we must do everything we can to ensure that we are ahead of them regarding naval tactics."

 DEN_Sub_Doctrine:0 "Develop Submarine Doctrines"

 DEN_Exerises:0 "Start National Exercises"

 DEN_Army_Improv:0 "Army Improvement Effort"
 DEN_Army_Improv_desc:0 "It is time to start improving our army and the equipment we issue it with it. Let us begin by improving our larger guns, such as our artillery, AA, and AT weapons. This will be the first step in that direction."

 DEN_Mot_Effort:0 "Motorization Effort"
 DEN_Mot_Effort_desc:0 "If we are to commence any offensive operations, we should have a motorized army, if at least partially. The [SWE.GetAdjective] have the Scania; the [GER.GetADjective]s have the Opel Blitz; perhaps we could look into purchasing examples of those to speed up our research."
 DEN_Mot_Effort_short_desc:0 "Motorization Effort"
 DEN_Mech_Effort:0 "Mechanization Effort"
 DEN_Mech_Effort_desc:0 "Our research has shown that a motorized army would be a great advantage to any offensive operation we might intend to do. We could develop vehicles with extra armor and better capabilities in terrain and create mechanized divisions."
 DEN_Mech_Effort_short_desc:0 "Mechanization Effort"
 DEN_Special_Forces:0 "Develop Special Forces"
 DEN_Special_Forces_desc:0 "Other nations are developing elite units such as marines and paratroopers. We could do the same.

 DEN_Light_Air_Focus:0 "Light Air Focus"

 DEN_Tac_Bomber_Focus:0 "Tactical Bomber Focus"
 DEN_Tac_Bomber_Focus_desc:0 "Tactical bombers are not as expensive to produce as strategic bombers but can be used in the same role. They have the added benefit of being a multi-role craft and, as such, can also strike enemy ground forces, albeit not as effectively as CAS aircraft."
 DEN_Tac_Bomber_Focus_short_desc:0 "Tactical Bomber Focus"
