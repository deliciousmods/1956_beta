##### Events
r56.news_event.906.t:0"Sweden revokes the Åland Convention!"
r56.news_event.906.d:0"The Åland Convention was signed in 1921, stating that the namesake islands were legally to be administrated by Finland, but as compensation, the area would not only be granted autonomy, it would also be entirely demilitarized. Seeing this as no longer in Sweden's favor, the largest Nordic nation has once again laid claim to the Islands. In response, Finland has remilitarized the archipelago, and diplomatic relations are starting to sharply decline between the two countries."
r56.news_event.906.a:0"All this over a few islands."
r56.news_event.906.b:0"Finally!"

sweden_aland.1.t:0 "Sweden Demands Åland"
sweden_aland.1.d:0 "Yesterday, the Swedish Government, having already restored their claim on Åland, made the next logical move- they demanded it outright. Representatives from Stockholm have a point when they say the islands are Swedish majority anyway, but our presence in the Baltic Sea would be vastly diminished. Still, the implication is that the alternative is war- and can we survive invasion?"
sweden_aland.1.a:0 "Accept the Demands."
sweden_aland.1.b:0 "Åland is rightfully ours!"
sweden_aland.12.t:0 "Finland Accepts Demands!"
sweden_aland.12.d:0 "Today, for the first time since 1809, the Swedish flag has replaced the Finnish banners flying in Åland. While the populace was mostly apathetic, the Swedish government itself, having scored a diplomatic victory and the most important Naval base in the Gulf of Bothnia, was overjoyed. Conversely, the mood in Finland was somber, and it's particularly notable that despite giving the islands up, Finland still retains a claim on them."
sweden_aland.12.a:0 "Finally!"
sweden_aland.13.t:0 "The Finns Refuse!"
sweden_aland.13.d:0 "The Finns have made the questionable decision that a small island chain is worth risking the lives of their people. Perhaps they have a desire to once again be part of our nation- whatever their train of thought may be, war seems inevitable."
sweden_aland.13.a:0 "Outrageous!"
sweden_aland.2.t:0 "Sweden offers guarantees for Åland."
sweden_aland.2.d:0 "Arriving today in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Swedish diplomats came with a suggestion. We give them the Åland islands, in exchange for them guaranteeing to come to our aid should we be attacked from outside forces."
sweden_aland.2.a:0 "It sounds like a fair trade. We agree."
sweden_aland.2.b:0 "No! The Åland Convention shall stand."
sweden_aland.21.t:0 "Finland transfer Åland"
sweden_aland.21.d:0 "Today the Åland Islands have been returnd to Swedish rule after a long time under Finnish and Russian rule. We are now bound by our obligation to protect Finland in case of any attack against them."
sweden_aland.21.a:0 "Välkommna Hem!"
sweden_aland.22.t:0 "Finland deny our offer of help."
sweden_aland.22.d:0 "Citing that the Åland Convetion was going to stay in place, the Finnish government has refused our offer for aid in future conflict in exchange for the Åland islands."
sweden_aland.22.a:0 "That's unfortunate..."

sweden_fascism.1.t:0 "Sweden Demands Subjugation"
sweden_fascism.1.d:0 "Yesterday, the Swedish Government, made a public statement that Denmark should submit to Swedish rule to ensure future prosperity. The demand includes the independence of Iceland and Swedish domination over Denmark and our Foreign Politics."

sweden_fascism.1.b:0 "Denmark will remain Danish!"
sweden_fascism.12.t:0 "Denmark Accepts Demands!"
sweden_fascism.12.d:0 "Today marks a glorious day in our History, the Swedish flag flying high in Copenhagen as they have now accepted Swedish rule."
sweden_fascism.12.a:0 "Finally!"
sweden_fascism.13.t:0 "The Danes Refuse!"
sweden_fascism.13.d:0 "The Danes have made the questionable decision to try and stand against our might. They will fall quickly beneath our boots."
sweden_fascism.13.a:0 "Outrageous!"

sweden_auth.1.t:0 "Sweden demands Annexation"
sweden_auth.1.d:0 "Today the Swedish Monarch demanded that we restore Swedish Rule over our country. It's been almost over a hundred years since we were separated, while there are some in the country who would like to go back to that, the majority are vying for independence. However, there are obvious hints of threats of violence in his demand."
sweden_auth.1.a:0 "Accept the Demands."
sweden_auth.1.b:0 "No! [ROOT.GetName] will remain independent!"
sweden_auth.12.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts Demands!"
sweden_auth.12.d:0 "It seems that [FROM.GetNameDef] realized the peculiar situation they found themselves in. In the end, they are safer as a part of Sweden instead of trying to stand alone against the changing times of Europe."
sweden_auth.12.a:0 "Finally!"
sweden_auth.13.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuse!"
sweden_auth.13.d:0 "While not unsurprising, we had hoped that the [FROM.GetAdjective] would have seen reason in our... request. However we also expected them to say no, it is no surprise to us that we now have to take up arms and retake what's ours."
sweden_auth.13.a:0 "To be expected..."
sweden_auth.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] demands a referendum"
sweden_auth.2.d:0 "Early today the Swedish Monarch, Carl Gustaf VI made a public statement, asking for the Danish people to vote for unification with Sweden, talking about the glorious days of the Kalmar Union. As a form of kindness he offered that the Danish People should be offered a chance for a referendum, whether or not if they should once more join with Sweden."
sweden_auth.2.a:0 "The People have spoken, we will comply."
sweden_auth.2.b:0 "No, we'd rather be ourselves."
sweden_auth.22.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] vote for unification."
sweden_auth.22.d:0 "In a slightly shocking turn of events, the Danish people voted in favour of unification of Sweden, it seemed that the people seek the safety of being a part of a larger nation of like minded people."
sweden_auth.22.a:0 "Välkomna hem, bröder!"
sweden_auth.23.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] refuse the referendum."
sweden_auth.23.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] refused the referendum and have prepared their forces in case we attack. Well, it is time to see how good they fight."
sweden_auth.23.a:0 "Expected."

sweden_nap.1.t:0 "[SWE.GetName] Proposes Treaty of Mutual Assistance"
sweden_nap.1.d:0 "Early today an envoy from Sweden arrived in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] with a proposal of a treaty of 'Mutual Assistance'.

sweden_soviet.1.t:0 "Sweden seeks to join [SOV.GetFactionName]"
sweden_soviet.1.d:0 "Ever since the Swedish workers seized control over their future their politicians have become friendlier towards us. Today, Swedish officials approached us about joining the [SOV.GetFactionName], it would be beneficial to have an ally who can potentially lock down the Baltic, but, it's also got its downsides, the Germans might think we're overreaching and feel threatened. What should our reply be?"

sweden_soviet.2.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"
sweden_soviet.3.t:0 "Moscow Refuse our Request"
sweden_soviet.3.d:0 "As our envoys reached out to the Soviets, we had expected a warmer reply, but, they were told that the Soviets had no intention in 'invinting want-to-be Germans into the [SOV.GetFactionName]'. This has caused some issues at home, but, it's not the first time we've been told no."
sweden_soviet.3.a:0 "We will just have to bide our time..."
sweden_soviet.4.t:0 "Sweden Raise the Åland Question"
sweden_soviet.4.d:0 " Early this morning, a telegram from Stockholm arrived in Moscow regarding the autonomous state of Åland, currently under Finnish control.

sweden_soviet.11.a:0 "Terrific!"
sweden_soviet.12.t:0 "The Finns Block our Demands"
sweden_soviet.12.d:0 "It seems that the Finns are too stubborn to realise the situation they are in, they've refused to transfer control over the states that our politicians have presented to them and have instead mobilized their armed forces towards the border. One way or another, we'll get the territory we want."
sweden_soviet.12.a:0 "Time for some War Games..."
sweden_soviet.13.t:0 "Sweden Seize Control"
sweden_soviet.13.d:0 "With our territories seized by the Swedish and the Soviet, the Swedes have stated that Finland is no longer in a state where they are able to survive on their own. Instead, they've made their intentions clear to ensure that the Finnish people survive the coming wars of Europe."
sweden_soviet.13.a:0 "We must bow..."
sweden_soviet.91.t:0 "Finland concedes Lappi"
sweden_soviet.91.d:0 "As the Swedes expected, the Finnish have sceeded Lappi as a result from the pressure and the potentiality of a two-front war for them."

sweden_soviet.101.t:0 "Finland Refuse Swedish Demands"
sweden_soviet.101.d:0 "In a surprising, yet not completely unfeasible turn of events, the Finns have denied the Swedes their claimed land. Now we shall see how strong our new ally truly is."
sweden_soviet.101.a:0 "Interesting..."
sweden_soviet.111.t:0 "Finland cave to the Soviets"
sweden_soviet.111.d:0 "Coming as absolutely no surprise, after having been forced to give us Lappi the Finns opted to give up their land as they otherwise risked invasion. But, soon Finland won't be a matter for concern anyway."
sweden_soviet.111.a:0 "To be expected."
sweden_soviet.112.t:0 "Finland stand defiant"
sweden_soviet.112.d:0 "It turns out that the Finns aren't as much of a push over as we may have anticipated, but nevertheless now they face Soviet wrath. It'll be a wonder if Finland survive for more than a month."
