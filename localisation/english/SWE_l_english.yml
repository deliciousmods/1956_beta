SWE_press_aland_claim:0 "Press the Åland Claim"
SWE_press_aland_claim_desc:0 "The Åland Islands have for a long time been away from Sweden, yet the people living there speak Swedish and identify as Swedes. Finland has no actual claim on the Islands other than what some paper states."
SWE_divide_denmark:0 "Divide Denmark"
SWE_divide_denmark_desc:0 "Denmark has historically been a thorn in our side, but we cannot deny that they are our Norse brothers. However, the times are changing and we need to look to the future. By assuring Germany Naval access and the return of Schleswig, we will force Denmark to face subjugation or annexation."
SWE_return_to_livonia:0 "Return to Livonia"
SWE_return_to_livonia_desc:0 "Livonia used to be Swedish territory and it's also got an incredible strategic value for helping us lock down the Baltic Sea as well as launch an invasion into the East. By securing our old lands we can move deep into Russia."
SWE_march_alongside_the_british_blackshirts:0 "March Alongside the British Blackshirts"
SWE_march_alongside_the_british_blackshirts_desc:0 "In a surprising turn of events, it seems that the British have also thrown of the shackles of Democracy and taken a new stance in the world. We should take this opportunity to ally with the British and then look towards Central Europe."
SWE_the_northern_front:0 "The Northern Front"
SWE_the_northern_front_desc:0 "As times are changing in Europe, it is time for Sweden to take the lead. By establishing our own faction we can gather those who share the same goal of crushing Communism and halting the rampancy of Capitalism."
SWE_legacy_of_great_northern_war:0 "Legacy of the Great Northern War"
SWE_legacy_of_great_northern_war_desc:0 "With our new allies we can now rebuke the Legacy that haunts our nation, the Great Northern War marked the first decline of our former Empire, but now, we can ensure that we will come out as victors."
SWE_establish_new_protectorates:0 "Establish New Protectorates"
SWE_establish_new_protectorates_desc:0 "With the young nation of Germany now beaten, we can look into splitting it apart once more, bringing back more... manageable pieces of the former German Eagle into our control."

SWE_secure_the_government_desc:0 "We can not sit by idly and wait while the world shifts around us. If Sweden is to make it out of the coming storm, stronger, not weaker, we need to act now. For the good of Sweden we have to stomp down on the political parties that are driving our nation apart and threatens to see Sweden undone."
SWE_sweden_first:0 "Sweden First"

### Focuses
SWE_royalist_return:0 "Royalist Return"
SWE_royalist_return_desc:0 "The Swedish monarchy was stripped of its powers in 1917 by a combination of Liberal and Social Democratic ministers under the leadership of Nils Edén. However, the world has become increasingly unstable as of recent times, and the constant bickering and dilly-dallying of democratic rule places the future of Sweden at risk."
SWE_king_gustafs_government:0 "King Gustaf's Government"
SWE_king_gustafs_government_desc:0 "King Gustaf V has ruled Sweden since the death of his father, Oscar II, in 1907. A staunch opponent of communism and prominent supporter of a pan-Scandinavian alliance, Gustaf has watched the rise of men like Lenin and Stalin with no small degree of concern. With the recent return of royal power, the King alone should govern again."
SWE_prince_gustafs_coup:0 "Prince Gustaf's Coup"
SWE_prince_gustafs_coup_desc:0 "Though Sweden has a King in Gustaf V, he is old, and incapable of the decisive action needed to save Sweden from falling to the predations of communism. To survive and thrive, Sweden needs a new, younger, dynamic King. Gustaf Adolf, son of the King's heir, must ascend to the throne - through force if necessary."
SWE_return_to_sweden_norway:0 "Return to Sweden-Norway"
SWE_return_to_sweden_norway_desc:0 "The separation of Sweden and Norway, which had been bound by treaty and blood for almost a hundred years, was a grave mistake indeed. Without Norway, we are tied to the Baltic, and without Sweden, Norway cannot possibly hope to protect itself, should the unthinkable happen and war come to Scandinavia. We must rectify this mistake."
SWE_the_finnish_crown:0 "The Finnish Crown"
SWE_the_finnish_crown_desc:0 "For six hundred years until the Finnish War, Finland has protected Sweden's eastern flank from the Russian bear. Finland is now cast adrift in the stormy seas of global politics, and the Russian bear creeps ever closer to their border. Finland must be saved from the Russians, and the eastern flank must be secure again!"
SWE_expand_livgardet:0 "Expand the Livgardet"
SWE_expand_livgardet_desc:0 "The Livgardet, or Life Guards, are one of the oldest military units still in service, since their foundation during the War of Liberation in 1521. Responsible for the defence of Stockholm and the royal family, they are the cream of the Swedish Army, and some of our finest troops. With the abrogation of democratic disarmament, we should look to expand the Life Guards, and bolster the core of our army."
SWE_modern_caroleans:0 "Modern Caroleans"
SWE_modern_caroleans_desc:0 "The Caroleans of Karl XII struck fear into the hearts of all who opposed him. Though Carolus Rex is no longer with us, his legacy lives on - let us restore the Caroleans to their rightful place, and once more strike fear into the hearts of Sweden's enemies!"
SWE_claim_the_danish_throne:0 "Claim the Danish Throne"
SWE_claim_the_danish_throne_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Denmark was once our puppet master during the days of the Kalmar Union. But times have changed. Now it is Sweden that is the stronger, and Denmark that languishes under weak and ineffectual rule by quarrelling politicians, blind to the dangers that mass on their borders. As rightful rulers of all Scandinavia, the Danish throne should be ours!"
SWE_demand_danish_referendum:0 "Demand Danish Referendum"
SWE_demand_danish_referendum_desc:0 "We will offer the Danes one chance to peacefully solve our... disagreement. If they agree to hold a referendum on their future, we will not enforce our claim to the Danish throne by force. Unless, that is, they say no..."
SWE_march_across_the_belts:0 "March across the Belts"
SWE_march_across_the_belts_desc:0 "The throne of Denmark is ours by right, and we will brook no interference. The Danish military has been crippled by years of neglect, underfunding and pacifist politics - they will be easy prey."
SWE_swedish_french_ties:0 "Swedish - French Ties"
SWE_swedish_french_ties_desc:0 "Sweden and France have enjoyed close ties ever since the beginning of the 18th century. French culture and the French language have been influential in Sweden ever since, and the current Swedish royal family descends from the French general Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, known in Sweden as Karl XIV. Now that France has returned to monarchism, we should deepen our ties with the French once again."
SWE_nordic_solidarity:0 "Nordic Solidarity"
SWE_nordic_solidarity_desc:0 "Since the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden has been relegated to a junior partner in terms of foreign affairs. When the reshaping of Europe took place in Vienna, we were there, but, we were considered lesser. No longer shall this be the case. By establishing our own alliance we show the world that we are no longer willing to be looked down upon."
SWE_stockholm_paris_agreement:0 "Stockholm - Paris Agreement"
SWE_stockholm_paris_agreement_desc:0 "The Germans are a common foe for both us and the French - and we have both lost lands to the Germans in days gone past. We will agree to support French claims to the left bank of the Rhine, in exchange for their recognition of our claims to northern Schleswig. We will fight side by side with the French once more, to reclaim what we have lost."
SWE_retake_pomerania:0 "Retake Pomerania"
SWE_retake_pomerania_desc:0 "Pomerania was once Swedish territory, until it was transferred to Denmark in exchange for Norway in 1814. Yet we have never forgotten our claims to Pomerania, no matter what the upstart Germans have to say. The Swedish Empire will be reclaimed in its entirety, and if that means war with Germany? So be it."
SWE_fortet_gotland:0 "Fortet Gotland"
SWE_fortet_gotland_desc:0 "Gotland is the largest island in the Baltic Sea, but represents a key vulnerability in the defence of the Kingdom - an invading force could easily establish a forward supply area there, and use it as a base of operations against the mainland! We must ensure this does not come to pass - our engineers have begun designing plans for fortifications and anti-aircraft batteries around suspected landing areas."
SWE_negotiate_with_norway:0 "Negotiate with Norway"
SWE_negotiate_with_norway_desc:0 "The Norwegian coastline is long and inadequately defended by Norway alone. If we and the Norwegians were to combine our strengths, we would better secure the defence of both our nations against any future invasion, either from the Baltic or the Atlantic."
SWE_discussions_with_denmark:0 "Discussions with Denmark"
SWE_discussions_with_denmark_desc:0 "Denmark's border with the Germans is an area of concern for Swedish defence planners - Jutland in particular is vulnerable to a quick German invasion from Kiel, after all. However, in the spirit of Scandinavian unity, we cannot allow the Danes to go undefended. We will support them in whatever way we can - even if it means war with Germany."
SWE_aland_for_guarantees:0 "Åland for Guarantees"
SWE_aland_for_guarantees_desc:0 "Åland has been contested by Finland and Sweden ever since the end of the Great War, and though the Finns retain control over the islands, support for unification with Sweden amongst the Ålanders is high. We will approach Finland with a deal; if they cede Åland to us, we will support them in their fight against the Russians for their independence."
SWE_the_northern_lights:0 "The Northern Lights"
SWE_the_northern_lights_desc:0 "With the foundations for a defensive alliance between the Scandinavian countries having been laid, it is now time to enshrine those guarantees into a formal alliance. Any who shall threaten one Scandinavian nation will face the might of all of Scandinavia against them."
SWE_secure_our_southern_border:0 "Secure our Southern Border"
SWE_secure_our_southern_border_desc:0 "Despite our differences in government, it would appear that the Germans are still most anxious to remain on relatively good terms with us in exchange for Swedish tungsten and iron ore. We will approach them with an offer of a pact of non-aggression between our two nations - which will also have the added benefit of allowing us to focus on the East..."
SWE_defend_the_baltics:0 "Defend the Baltics"
SWE_defend_the_baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic states, much like the Finns, are under increasing threat from a resurgent Russian state that may seek to re-occupy their lands once more, as the Tsarists did until 1917. We cannot, in good conscience, permit this to happen - delegations will be sent to Riga, Kaunas and Tallinn to begin drawing up plans to include them in our alliance."
SWE_ally_the_kaiserreich:0 "Ally the Kaiserreich"
SWE_ally_the_kaiserreich_desc:0 "The return of the German Kaiser - long a friend of the Swedish royal family - to his throne presents a unique opportunity for us to form an alliance of monarchies against the Russians. Though we stayed out of the First World War, we will not permit a resurgent Russia to threaten ourselves or the Kaiserreich. We must send a delegation to Berlin at once."
SWE_joint_panzer_development:0 "Joint Panzer Development"
SWE_joint_panzer_development_desc:0 "The Germans are some of the foremost tank designers in Europe. To prepare ourselves for the great struggle against the Russians, we should send a team of technical staff to assist in the development of new, jointly-designed armoured fighting vehicles."
SWE_baltic_foothold:0 "Baltic Foothold"
SWE_baltic_foothold_desc:0 "The so-called 'Baltic states' were brought into existence at the end of the First World War, and are weak and surrounded by predatory neighbours that are simply waiting for an opportunity to reincorporate one or all of them into themselves. We should take the initiative, and re-establish a Swedish presence in the Baltic for the first time since the Great Northern War."
SWE_prepare_for_the_march_east:0 "Prepare for the March East"
SWE_prepare_for_the_march_east_desc:0 "The march to Moscow will be a long and arduous one, and the Russian climate can be most dangerous to those unprepared. We cannot - we must not - repeat the mistakes of those who came before us; we must prepare ourselves for a long and difficult campaign, and ensure that our troops are always adequately supplied, no matter the distance from Stockholm."
SWE_reclaim_the_imperial_east:0 "Reclaim the Imperial East"
SWE_reclaim_the_imperial_east_desc:0 "The time is now. We will no longer stand by as the Russians continue to grow in strength. Sweden must act if we are to secure our future - our imperial future. To war!"

SWE_unite_scandinavia:0 "Unite Scandinavia"
SWE_unite_scandinavia_desc:0 "With War brewing on the horizon, it is time once more for us Scandinavians to ensure our own security, should external threats come for us, we need to stand unified against them or we will fall one by one."
SWE_the_second_brother:0 "The Second Brother"
SWE_the_second_brother_desc:0 "Our recent history with Norway is a tumultuos one, but, we need to mend the wounds that were left behind from the dissolution of the Sweden-Norway union."
SWE_the_third_brother:0 "The Third Brother"
SWE_the_third_brother_desc:0 "Denmark has been everything from an antagonistic overlord to a close ally. It is time to ensure that Swedes and Danes remember the times of kinship and once more work to protect one another."
SWE_the_fourth_brother:0 "The Fourth Brother"
SWE_the_fourth_brother_desc:0 "The Finns are in a vulnerable position, having just gained their independence from the Russians where they were had been subservient for far too long, now, we will show them what it is like to be an equal."
SWE_the_scandinavian_council:0 "The Scandinavian Council"
SWE_the_scandinavian_council_desc:0 "With our brethren reassured, we can now comfortably call ourselves Scandinavian."
SWE_the_honorary_scandinavian:0 "The Honorary Scandinavian"
SWE_the_honorary_scandinavian_desc:0 "Estonia used to be part of the former Swedish Empire under the name of Livonia, their historical ties to us can not be overlooked either, we should offer them a place within our newly formed Union, should they want it."
SWE_integrate_iceland:0 "Integrate Iceland"
SWE_integrate_iceland_desc:0 "Iceland, despite its distance from Scandinavia, is culturally and historically Scandinavian. It is only logical they get the option to join into our union as well should they feel like it."
SWE_decentralized_command_structure:0 "Decentralized Command Structure"
SWE_decentralized_command_structure_desc:0 "By spreading out our command structure we make ourselves harder to conquer. Allowing regional commanders more freedom of control and decision making will also make it easier to defend our lands as they are more capable of adapting to the situations they know best."
SWE_centralized_command_structure:0 "Centralized Command Structure"
SWE_centralized_command_structure_desc:0 "By focusing our command structure to a single location we will be able to more easily divert logistics and supplies to regions that need it more than others. By having battleplans and attack vectors coming from one location, we also ensure that everyone knows what will happen and how."
SWE_north_sea_supremacy:0 "North Sea Supremacy"
SWE_north_sea_supremacy_desc:0 "By ensuring that we have supremacy over the North Sea we will be able to protect any travel that moves through our waters as well as in and out of the Baltic Sea. However, our future enemies may try and use our long coasts against us, so it is vital that we gain control of the waters to prevent hostile landings on our shores."
SWE_nordic_joint_air_command:0 "Nordic Joint Air Command"
SWE_nordic_joint_air_command_desc:0 "Centralizing our Air Command structure will aid us in every element where our airforce is active. Whether it is striking hardpoints with deadly accuracy or ensuring that even the most distant regions have a steady income of supplies."
SWE_the_northern_crowns:0 "The Northern Crowns"
SWE_the_northern_crowns_desc:0 "The idea of a single battleship to dominate them all is the dreams of many, however the truth is that no Battleship can operate alone, and while capable on its own, it needs aid from its brethren, just like us."
SWE_regional_capital_development:0 "Regional Capital Development"
SWE_regional_capital_development_desc:0 "By developping the capitals of our constituent states, we'll help and prevent a quick collapse should Stockholm fall as well as improve the relations with those whom make up our union."
SWE_central_military_industry:0 "Central Military Industry"

SWE_scandinavian_volunteers:0 "Scandinavian Volunteers"
SWE_scandinavian_volunteers_desc:0 "While we have had a long period of neutrality, it is time that we change that. By allowing our armed forces to travel abroad as volunteers in foreign conflicts we can help and bring change to Europe without directly engaging in the conflict ourselves."
SWE_centralized_industrial_planning:0 "Centralized Industrial Planning"
SWE_centralized_industrial_planning_desc:0 "With more efficient planning comes better results. From the south to the north, having a centralized structure will prove, in the long term, to have been more efficient."
SWE_baltic_supremacy:0 "Baltic Supremacy"
SWE_baltic_supremacy_desc:0 "The Baltic is one of the life lines of our nation, by fortifying the islands we hold we ensure that those who seek to traverse our waters are unable to do so without our knowledge."

sweden.70.d:0"Gustaf V has called a meeting with several top political figures of Sweden, particularly those of the NSAP. He's been concerned lately about the NSAP's authoritarian views, and while opposed to Communism, doesn't see it as a particularly potent threat as the NSAP does. If the King could be convinced of the threat the Bolsheviks pose, it would be quite the boon for the NSAP's popularity among the people..."
sweden.70.a:0"Show him the evils of Communism."
sweden.70.b:0"His opinion doesn't matter."

sweden.72.t:0"Royalist Newspapers"
sweden.72.d:0"It seems King Gustaf has not taken this exile thing with the good humor we had hoped he would. He has joined with a group of dissidents to publish slander about our government! That old fool is just jealous HE doesn't get a seat of power anymore."
sweden.72.a:0"Seize and burn the publications!"
sweden.72.b:0"It's not worth the effort."

sweden.75.t:0"Unite with Finland-Swedes"
sweden.75.d:0"Some of our newly acquired lands in Finland are majority Swedish, and would comfortably be ruled under Sweden proper rather than as a part of Finland. Of course, setting this up would mean a weaker Finnish puppet state if we choose to create one..."
sweden.75.a:0"Swedes under Sweden."
sweden.75.b:0"This is not worth the risk."

sweden.90.t:0"The Regal Cabinet"
sweden.90.d:0"The King has defied Per Albin Hansson's long-standing policy of avoiding any foreign alliance by establishing a pact with Finland, which has opened up a divide between the two former amicable rulers. The King is within full legal right to dismiss and replace him, though this would surely displease the Republican elements of our population. Should Gustaf V carry this plan out?"
sweden.90.a:0"Let the King form his Council."
sweden.90.b:0"Only if he wins the election."

sweden.100.t:0"The Stockholm Communiqué"
sweden.100.d:0"Swedish King Gustaf V has invited the leaders of Norway and Denmark to a conference to discuss our relations, Europe's future, and where our nations would stand in the case of war. Attending would draw us all closer together, but is such a thing truly what we want?"
sweden.100.a:0"Attend the Conference"
sweden.100.b:0"No, this is not in our intrest"

sweden.105.t:0"Operation Stella Polaris"
sweden.105.d:0"The Soviets are dominating our poor nation so far, which is putting us at excessive risk of losing sensitive information- and we'd risk quite a bit if we let any of these important documents fall into Papa Joe's clutches. Our agents suggest we move operations to Sweden, a safer base that's far more removed from conflict, though we will lose some efficiency if we choose to do this."
sweden.105.a:0"Send them to Sweden"
sweden.105.b:0"They are needed here!"

sweden.106.t:0"Operation Stella Polaris"
sweden.106.d:0"An unidentified man in a black trenchcoat met up with our head of government today at the Finnish ministry after dark, and explained in a deep, artificial sounding voice that Finland's war with the Soviets going so badly is putting sensitive information at risk. His proposal is to harbor the information here in Sweden instead- with the payment being the right to see some of the information ourselves, on top of the increased relations. The Russians would never approve of such a thing, however."
sweden.106.a:0"Perform the Operation"
sweden.106.b:0"No, this is too risky"

finland.40.t:0"Ask for Swedish help?"
finland.40.d:0"As our country has devolved into Civil War against a power obviously being supported by the Soviet Union, we've been forced to look for allies ourselves. Sweden is an obvious sponsor- if we are able to secure their assistance, it would be a major boon to our side. Of course, the status of Åland is still in question, and while regrettable, it has been determined to be fair compensation..."
finland.40.a:0"Ask Sweden to join"
finland.40.b:0"No, this is our War!"

finland.41.t:0"Finland calls for help"
finland.41.d:0"The White Guard of Finland is asking for our help against the Communists attempting to take control of their nation. They have also promised us Åland as compensation for our help- quite a valuable trade! Are Swedish lives worth wasting in a foreign war, however?"

sweden.43.t:0"Åland Rises Up!"
sweden.43.d:0"Patriotic citizens of Åland have joined the fight against the Communist threat and are eagerly marching towards the front lines now...as part of the Swedish army. Still, this is a good alternative to Red rule."

iceland.1.t:0"Icelandic Mutiny"
iceland.1.d:0"A fascist mutiny has occurred! After minor inspections, it's pretty obvious that they are supplied. While the entire country is in riots, what stance do we take? Do we silence it or not? Since silencing it might lead to it's supplier to take it's own action. The two most likely suppliers at this point are Germany or Sweden."

iceland.11.t:0"Iceland Silences the Uprising!"
iceland.11.d:0"It seems like our planned uprising in Iceland didn't quite go as we expected. It seems that the government has been able to silence it with their limited resources. The question is: What do we do now? We could launch a full military invasion ourselves but then we'd also have to deal with Denmark and most likely Greenland."

Seeing this as no longer in Sweden's favor, the largest Nordic nation has once again laid claim to the Islands. In response, Finland has remilitarized the archipelago, and diplomatic relations are starting to sharply decline between the two countries."

sweden_aland.1.t:0 "Sweden Demands Åland"
sweden_aland.1.d:0 "Yesterday, the Swedish Government, having already restored their claim on Åland, made the next logical move- they demanded it outright.

sweden_aland.12.t:0 "Finland Accepts Demands!"
sweden_aland.12.d:0 "Today, for the first time since 1809, the Swedish flag has replaced the Finnish banners flying in Åland. While the populace was mostly apathetic, the Swedish government itself, having scored a diplomatic victory and the most important Naval base in the Gulf of Bothnia, was overjoyed. Conversely, the mood in Finland was somber, and it's particularly notable that despite giving the islands up, Finland still retains a claim on them."
sweden_aland.12.a:0 "Finally!"
sweden_aland.13.t:0 "The Finns Refuse!"
sweden_aland.13.d:0 "The Finns have made the questionable decision that a small island chain is worth risking the lives of their people. Perhaps they have a desire to once again be part of our nation- whatever their train of thought may be, war seems inevitable."

However, there are obvious hints of threats of violence in his demand."

sweden_auth.2.d:0 "Early today the Swedish Monarch, Carl Gustaf VI made a public statement, asking for the Danish people to vote for unification with Sweden, talking about the glorious days of the Kalmar Union.

sweden_soviet.1.d:0 "Ever since the Swedish workers seized control over their future their politicians have become friendlier towards us. Today, Swedish officials approached us about joining the [SOV.GetFactionName], it would be beneficial to have an ally who can potentially lock down the Baltic, but, it's also got its downsides, the Germans might think we're overreaching and feel threatened.
