 NOR_swedish_claims_desc_mon: "Unwillingly, our history and royalties have been tied to [SWE.GetNonIdeologyName]'s. During that back and forth that has lasted centuries, the [SWE.GetAdjective] stole vast tracts of land; Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.

 NOR_eirik_raudes_land_desc: "The Hague's absurd decision in 1933 must be overturned. How dare they let [DEN.GetName] have the land that Erik the Red, a Norwegian, discovered a millennium back.

 NOR_consolidate_kingdom_desc: "Now that our gracious Markis Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg, Royal Chamberlain and right hand of our beloved Haakon VII has expanded the lands of our crown, we must look inwards to consolidate our gains and rule over our subjects with a gilded and steady, if a little stern, hand."
 
## The Rest 
 NOR_start_rearmament: "Start Rearmament"

 NOR_kickstart_military_industry: "Kickstart Military Industry"
 NOR_kickstart_military_industry_desc: "[ROOT.GetName] has been a subject of other nations for a long time, and thus never developed an internal military industry. To protect our freedom, we must stop relying on other countries for our defensive production and start building up our war machine."
 NOR_build_supplies_network: "Build Supplies Network"

 NOR_drobak_coastal_fort: "Drøbak Coastal Fort"

 NOR_anti_air_support_desc: "Regardless of where the invader comes from, one thing is certain, they will try to use their planes to gain control of the skies and bomb our cities and troops. That is unless we set up anti-aircraft defenses to neutralize any attempt from the air."
 NOR_rikstanken: "Rikstanken"
 NOR_rikstanken_desc: "The sad truth is, [ROOT.GetName] has never owned a tank before. If we hope to have any chance of victory, armor is a given. The question is, what should our approach be? A large number of tanks might be a costly proposition for a country in our situation; perhaps we can test the waters with a single tank? Or maybe, we can sacrifice something other than money for the nation's tanks."
 NOR_tank_procurement: "Tank Procurement"
 NOR_tank_procurement_desc: "Our indigenous tank program is clearly insufficient for the armored warfare of the 20th century. The bright side is that many countries with the required expertise and production volume might be making their armored vehicles available for sale, this would be a great shortcut for bringing the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Army into this century."
 NOR_norges_rikstanksfabrikk: "Norges Rikstanksfabrikk"
 NOR_norges_rikstanksfabrikk_desc: "Now that we've learned the basics of armored warfare, we are ready to develop our own national tank manufacturing program, or Rikstanksfabrikk. It is the only way we can guarantee an uninterrupted supply of armored vehicles."
 NOR_improve_production_lines: "Improve Production lines"
 NOR_improve_production_lines_desc: "There is no point in bravery in the defense of our country if we can't provide the weapons and equipment to keep fighting. Modern warfare is all about having the bullets to fight back, let's make sure we can make them as fast as we can fire them."

 NOR_hurtigruten_desc: "There's no denying that [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] is not only an unusually long country, but also has very difficult terrain all around.

 NOR_norges_tekniske_hogskole: "Norges Tekniske Høgskole"
 NOR_norges_tekniske_hogskole_desc: "For over two decades, the Norwegian institute of Technology in Trondheim has been at the forefront of engineering in the country, but if we hope to compete with our neighbors and possibly our enemies, more funding into technical education will be necessary.

 NOR_empower_large_industrial_groups_desc: "Large industrial enterprises have a proven track record of building and maintaining factories, producing the every day necessities of the average [ROOT.GetAdjective] citizen.

 NOR_build_the_northern_rail: "Build the Northern Rail"
 NOR_build_the_northern_rail_desc: "Too long has the northern part of our country been neglected. Though the terrain makes building infrastructure a complicated endeavor, it's an effort that we are sure will pay dividends in the future."

 NOR_increase_research_funding: "Increase Research Funding"

 NOR_revamp_hydroelectric_capacity: "Revamp Hydroelectric Capacity"
 NOR_revamp_hydroelectric_capacity_desc: "Aluminum is vital for the construction of airplanes and other implements of war, but the amount of energy required to process the bauxite into Aluminum makes it a costly process. Fortunately for us, [NOR.GetName] has the perfect topography for turning our many lakes and rivers into hydroelectric dams. So we can produce the aluminum needed despite not having any large deposits of bauxite."
 NOR_haerens_flyvevaaben: "Hærens Flyvevaaben"
 NOR_haerens_flyvevaaben_desc: "The new frontier of warfare is in the skies. If we let the enemy have total control over our airspace, our ground forces will not be able to act effectively. We must develop an air force that can act in favor of our ground troops."
 NOR_norwegian_planes: "Norwegian Planes "
 NOR_norwegian_planes_desc: "We have witnessed that today's allies could be tomorrow's invaders, for this reason we cannot rely on foreign powers for our planes, their importance in the modern battle field is to great."

 NOR_anti_air_construction: "Anti-Air Construction"
 NOR_anti_air_construction_desc: "Our rugged terrain makes [NOR.GetName] a difficult target for enemy invasion, but our skies are exposed to enemy aircraft, which makes them an advantage for a potential foreign invasion. We must build the necessary anti-air batteries to prevent this."

 NOR_expand_merchant_marine_desc: "Modern warfare needs resources and equipment, two things that [ROOT.GetName] is desperately lacking.

 DEN_expand_the_resistance_desc: "While there have been many different resistance groups from all walks of life emerging since the occupation started, we must rally even more people to these groups if we ever hope to beat back the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] forces from our lands."

 DEN_create_danforce: "Create the Danforce"
 DEN_create_danforce_desc: "[?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDefCap] has forbidden us from having a military large enough to truly threaten their supremacy. We must instead look elsewhere for a free and amicable nation to train and supply a force that can participate in liberating [DEN.GetNameDef] from oppression."

 DEN_buy_foreign_aircraft_desc: "We must strengthen the Danish Brigade by acquiring airplanes to rival [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef] for supremacy in the skies over [DEN.GetNameDef]."
 DEN_rigid_training: "Rigid Training"
 DEN_rigid_training_desc: "Numbers alone will not give us supremacy in the skies. We must put our pilots through rigorous training so that they can keep the heavens free from [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] airplanes."
 DEN_strengthen_the_danish_brigades: "Strengthen the Danish Brigades"
 DEN_strengthen_the_danish_brigades_desc: "We will not be able to amass the same firepower that [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef] has, so we must fight smart and outwit them instead. We must study our enemies and find their weaknesses in order to exploit them on the battlefield."
 DEN_support_battalions: "Support Battalions"
 DEN_support_battalions_desc: "If the Danish Brigade is to be a functioning force and have a chance to liberate [ROOT.GetNameDef], they must have adequate material. Rifles and machineguns are all very well, but artillery and anti-air support is mandatory in this day and age."
 DEN_expand_the_brigades: "Expand the Brigades"
 DEN_expand_the_brigades_desc: "To secure the Danish Brigade's chances of liberating [ROOT.GetNameDef], we need to add more manpower to their divisions."
 DEN_establish_danske_flotille: "Establish Den Danske Flotille"
 DEN_establish_danske_flotille_desc: "By establishing a flotilla in exile, we can train the men and hold naval drills that will sharpen their skills to help in the liberation of our lands. Our fleet will face severe opposition in the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] navy and we must gain the upper hand in any way we can."
 DEN_buy_foreign_ships: "Procure Destroyers"
 DEN_buy_foreign_ships_desc: "To secure [DEN.GetNameDef]’s coastline and many islands we must first secure a capable fleet that can protect our sea lanes.

 DEN_align_with_foreign_powers_desc: "[?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDefCap] will not give up an inch of conquered soil without a fight, and we can not possibly stand up against their military might on our own.

 DEN_intel_sharing: "Intel Sharing"
 DEN_intel_sharing_desc: "Deepening the cooperation with our allies against [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef] by sharing intelligence between our countries will strengthen our bonds and ability to eventually topple the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] oppression."
 DEN_ask_for_weapons: "Request Weapon Deliveries"
 DEN_ask_for_weapons_desc: "Our [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] overlords keep depleting our weapon and munition stockpiles, crippling our ability to fight back when the day comes to declare our independence once again. We could ask our allies to airdrop the necessary supplies for us to replenish our empty inventories."
 DEN_buy_allied_weapons: "Procure Allied Weapons"
 DEN_buy_allied_weapons_desc: "As a smaller nation, our ability to produce armament is limited - and to secure our independence we must acquire the best possible equipment out there. Perhaps we could convince our allies to supply us with the necessary arms in a subsidized deal."

 DEN_align_with_overlord_desc: "While me managed to retain a high level of independence in our peace deal with [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef], we are still merely a puppet. This does open us up to intriguing opportunities however. Perhaps, if we were to align ourselves with [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective], we could take advantage of our stronger overlord and turn this defeat into victory..."
 DEN_seek_industrial_investments: "Seek Industrial Investments"
 DEN_seek_industrial_investments_desc: "Having aligned ourselves with [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef] and won some of their trust and favor, we find ourselves in an opportune situation where we can ask our overlord to invest in our industries and bolster our production capabilities."

 DEN_pledge_allegiance_desc: "To be able to fully take advantage of our relationship with [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef] we must pledge our allegiance to them - leaving them no doubt of our sincerity in our ambitions to create a symbiotic partnership, where both nations can grow and benefit."

 DEN_petition_for_independence_desc: "We have played our part and assisted our [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] masters in all of their endeavors.

 DEN_seize_the_production: "Seize the Means of Production"
 DEN_seize_the_production_desc: "Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. To achieve our full industrial potential, we must seize the means of production. This will ensure that the industries serve the need of the nation and that they run as efficiently as possible."

 DEN_adjust_industrial_prioritize_desc: "War is upon us and we must act accordingly by adjusting our industries to produce and contribute to the war effort. Every man and woman must understand and perform their duty without complaint to serve the need of the country."
 DEN_increase_cooperation: "Increased Cooperation"
 DEN_increase_cooperation_desc: "Though we might not like to admit it, we would never have been able to hold back the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] invasion - and by capitulating we ensured a certain level of autonomy no other country under [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] enjoys. Therefore, we should endeavor to work more closely with our overlords to secure this independence and reap the benefits of this relationship."
 DEN_acquire_military_equipment: "Acquire Military Equipment"
 DEN_acquire_military_equipment_desc: "As a smaller nation, our ability to produce armaments is limited - but to truly contribute to the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetFactionName] war effort we must acquire the best possible equipment out there. Perhaps we could convince our allies to supply us with the necessary arms in a subsidized deal."
 DEN_contribute_to_the_war: "Contribute to the War Effort"
 DEN_contribute_to_the_war_desc: "Even though we have made our stance and intentions toward our [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetAdjective] overlords clear, they will not allow us to develop our military any further. Only by joining the [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetFactionName] and pledging to contribute to the war effort will we ever be allowed to improve our army, navy, and air force. And with the backing of [?DEN.DEN_overlord_nation.GetNameDef] we could turn our eyes toward the rest of the Nordic countries..."
 DEN_secure_the_norwegian_coast: "Secure the Norwegian Coast"
 DEN_secure_the_norwegian_coast_desc: "Denmark and Norway were unified for centuries, and if we want to control the North Sea, or expand beyond that, we must once again unify our countries. The Norwegian coast is a vital stepping stone if we want to dominate the Atlantic."
 DEN_reclaim_atlantic_islands: "Reclaim Our Atlantic Possessions"
 DEN_reclaim_atlantic_islands_desc: "The Faroes and Iceland might not have any natural resources to speak of, but it is nevertheless part of our realm and of vital strategic importance since the islands act as a stepping stone to dominate the North Atlantic.\n\nGreenland is the only part of our nation that actually has any kind of natural resources required to run a modern and effective military, making it our utmost priority."
 DEN_claim_sweden: "Claim Sweden"
 DEN_claim_sweden_desc: "The Swedes were once our fiercest rivals and were under our dominance on and off for centuries. And contrary to Denmark, Sweden has an abundance of natural resources that are required to run a modern military.

 DEN_safeguard_the_eastern_front_desc: "Finland has always been just out of our reach historically speaking, but with our resurgent power, we are more than capable to lay it under our hegemony. Securing Finland means securing our Eastern Front and strengthening our control over the Baltic Sea."
#Military Branch
 DEN_sign_forsvarsforliget: "Sign Forsvarsforliget"
 DEN_sign_forsvarsforliget_desc: "With tensions rising in Europe once again, we must confess that our current defense capabilities are severely lacking. Signing a new defense agreement to increase the funding for the army, navy, and air forces would strengthen our military ability and secure our nation's integrity."
 DEN_stockpile_oil: "Stockpile Oil"
 DEN_stockpile_oil_desc: "We must be ready for the worst and start preparing for war. Even if we never see combat, a major conflict in our vicinity will affect us. To minimize this impact we need to amass large reserves of strategic resources."

 DEN_expand_vaernepligten: "Expand Værnepligten"
 DEN_expand_vaernepligten_desc: "The military is barely even a token force, completely incapable of deterring any would-be invaders. If they are to put up an actual defense of the nation, we need to rapidly expand our conscription."
 DEN_haeren_reorganization: "Hæren Reorganization"
 DEN_haeren_reorganization_desc: "The Danish army is small and wholly unprepared to defend our borders. It must be reorganized into an effective fighting force with an efficient central command to maintain our independence and deter potential enemies."
 DEN_expand_haerens_tekniske_korps: "Expand Hærens Tekniske Korps"
 DEN_expand_haerens_tekniske_korps_desc: "The Army’s Technical Corps operates the Weapons Arsenal and Hærens Geværfabrik, which produces both weapons and ammunition.

 DEN_hjemmevaernet: "Hjemmeværnet"
 DEN_hjemmevaernet_desc: "There are plenty of people ready to rise up and defend Denmark from any aggressor. We should utilize the fighting spirit of these people by forming a home guard - in case someone would be foolish enough to invade us."

 DEN_expand_dansk_industri_syndikat_desc: "Dansk Industri Syndikat, or Riffelsyndikatet as it is commonly known, is the country’s largest weapons manufacturer and produces our army’s Madsen rifles. Investing in and expanding their factories is of utmost national security interest."
 DEN_new_artillery_tactics: "New Artillery Tactics"
 DEN_new_artillery_tactics_desc: "Hærens Tekniske Korps produces guns and artillery and ammunition today. But by setting up an experimental division within Hærens Tekniske Korps we could perhaps design and produce our own artillery, something the army would benefit greatly from."
 DEN_convert_automobile_production: "Convert Automobile Production"
 DEN_convert_automobile_production_desc: "The time has come to order Danish automobile manufacturers to convert their civilian production lines to contribute to the war effort and support our defense capabilities. Securing our own production of trucks and mechanizing our army to a higher degree would make it more agile and flexible."
 DEN_slaedepatruljen_sirius: "Slædepatruljen Sirius"
 DEN_slaedepatruljen_sirius_desc: "Mainland Denmark gets very little snow in the winter, and it rarely stays for long. However, we do possess Greenland, where the snow is kilometers thick all year round. We can take advantage of this and train our troops there to acclimatize them to the cold."
 DEN_generalkommandoen: "Generalkommandoen "
 DEN_generalkommandoen_desc: "Well-trained, well-disciplined, and well-functioning officers are the roots of a successful army. We should aim to produce the most efficient and competent officers in the world and fill our general staff with them."
 DEN_establish_domestic_tank_manufacturing: "Establish Domestic Tank Manufacturing"
 DEN_establish_domestic_tank_manufacturing_desc: "Warfare has changed significantly in the 20th century - and we must change with it. A fast-moving, hard-punching army is the key to victorious battles nowadays. Securing our own supply of tanks will ensure success on the modern battlefield."
 DEN_expand_ubadsvabnet: "Expand Ubådsvåbnet"
 DEN_expand_ubadsvabnet_desc: "The best protection of our coastline and many islands, is the one the enemy can not see. Having a large submarine fleet will allow us to strike without being noticed and withdraw our forces without taking losses."

 DEN_modernize_the_navy: "Modernize the Navy"

 DEN_sovaernets_operative_kommando: "Søværnets Operative Kommando"
 DEN_sovaernets_operative_kommando_desc: "We need a competent central command structure that can coordinate our navies efficiently. Only the best and brightest officers should be trusted with this duty."
 DEN_appropriate_odense_staalskibsvaerft: "Appropriate Odense Staalskibsværft"
 DEN_appropriate_odense_staalskibsvaerft_desc: "To truly expand the size of our navy, we need additional production capabilities. Seizing A.P. Møller-Mærsk’s shipyards in Odense would accelerate our means of production significantly."
 DEN_restructuring_sovaernet: "Restructuring Søværnet"
 DEN_restructuring_sovaernet_desc: "Having been at peace for so many decades, a number of faults in our naval command structure had gone unnoticed. The only way to deal with them now is a full reorganization of Søværnet."
 DEN_baltic_sea_domination: "Baltic Sea Domination"
 DEN_baltic_sea_domination_desc: "Before the rise of the Russian empire, and even before the short-lived Swedish empire, Denmark looked to dominate the Baltic Sea. To truly secure our independence and safeguard our homelands, we need to once again aim to control all of the Baltic Sea through naval supremacy."
 DEN_north_sea_ambitions: "North Sea Ambitions"
 DEN_north_sea_ambitions_desc: "Ours is a wide-reaching nation, from the shores of Europe to the seas of the North Atlantic.

 DEN_fromandskorpset_desc: "The recent improvements in both the army and the navy have strengthened our military substantially. We find ourselves more than capable of projecting our power far and wide, over the waters and unto foreign shores - if we so wish."
 DEN_domestic_designs: "Domestic Designs"
 DEN_domestic_designs_desc: "Our air forces are severely lacking in capability. This mostly stems from the fact that we don’t produce our own aircraft, and therefore don’t have the numbers to put up a fight if worse comes to worst. We need to establish a domestic production line for our very own airplanes."
 DEN_foreign_designs: "Foreign Designs"
 DEN_foreign_designs_desc: "Neither of our two air forces has the capability to design and build a functioning fighter or bomber. We should look elsewhere to purchase aircraft. If we find the design satisfying we can look into acquiring a production license. "
 DEN_unify_flyvevabnet: "Unify Flyvevåbnet"
 DEN_unify_flyvevabnet_desc: "As it stands right now, we have two different and wholly separate air forces; the army’s Hærens Flyvertropper, and the navy’s Marinens Flyvevæsen. Both branches are often at odds with each other. Unifying them into one, single airforce unit would create a cohesive strategy and establish a new branch of the armed forces."
 DEN_flyvertaktisk_kommando: "Flyvertaktisk Kommando"
 DEN_flyvertaktisk_kommando_desc: "Having unified the two different branches of the airforce into one unit is not enough. For this new military branch to be as efficient and cohesive as possible, we need to create a central command structure that can coordinate the airforce properly."
 DEN_air_force_power_projection: "Air Force Power Projection"
 DEN_air_force_power_projection_desc: "Now that we have unified Flyvevåbnet into the third major branch of our military, we can focus on securing the skies of our widespread realm. A large and successful air force is still dependent on air bases where it can land and take off from."
 DEN_flyveskolen: "Flyveskolen"
