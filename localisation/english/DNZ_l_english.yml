 danzig.1.t:0 "The Free City of Danzig"
 danzig.1.desc:0 "After the Great War, the Free City of Danzig was established to ensure the use of a port for the newly reborn Polish state. This compromise was necessary instead of a complete annexation because the vast majority of the population of Danzig is ethnically German.\n\nThe rise of ultranationalism in Germany has brought total control of the local institutions to the NSDAP. Currently, those Nazi politicians' desire for reunification with Germany is kept relatively quiet, but this could change soon. The City-State would most likely disappear and be annexed by either Poland or Germany in a crisis."

Germany has petitioned the League of Nations on Danzig's behalf about the issue, and the League might give in to Germany's demands. If they do, the League will replace the city's Commissioner with a new spineless Commissioner who will go along with whatever the Danzig's local government wants!\n\nIt's clear that Danzig is no longer operating as a 'Free City'."

 DNZ_danzig_senate_desc:0 "With unemployment at an all-time high within the Free City and a substantial ethnic German population, it should be easy to convince the people of Danzig to vote us in. Once we have official control of the Senate, we won't let it go without a fight; I am the Senate!"
