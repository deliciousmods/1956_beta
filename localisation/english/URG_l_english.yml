 uruguay.1.d:0 "Two days ago, Gabriel Terra went on a diplomatic visit to Argentina, mainly in connection with a revision of certain trade treaties between the two nations, following the adoption of a more protectionist policy by the new government, initiated in particular by Vice-President Luis Alberto de Herrera.\nOn the night of his return, around two in the morning, contacts with the plane supposed to take the president back to Uruguay were lost.\nThe wreck was found the next day, right in the middle of the Rio Negro. No passengers survived.\n\nAs the country recovers from the shock of losing the President who allowed Uruguay to emerge from the Great Depression and modernized the political system by allying Uruguay's two main political parties, Luis Alberto de Herrera is preparing to assume Uruguay's presidency."

This was followed by the abolition of the constitution and strong censorship of the press, and formed a government composed of conservatives and anti-liberals, which would put in place the 1934 constitution."
 URG_axis_loans:0 "Axis Loans"
 URG_axis_loans_desc:0 "It is obvious that the United States and Great Britain are and will remain our main trading partners, but we could extend our trade opportunities by reaching out to the European fascist nations, and in particular to Italy and Germany.

 URG_suspend_elections:0 "Alliance With Herrera"
 URG_suspend_elections_desc:0 "Terra's work is not yet finished, but cannot continue with a system as limiting as the current Uruguayan constitution is, despite many efforts to strengthen the presidency.

 URG_democracy_and_socialism_desc:0 "The fight against exploitation cannot and must not be fought by tyrannical means, because we would only be falling into a loop that would eventually repeat the mistakes of the previous system.

The persecutions brought about by the regime forced many politicians and intellectuals to flee, particularly towards Argentina.\n\nHowever, the dictatorship is far from being entrenched, with a first revolutionary coup attempt in 1935, which may well not be the last."
