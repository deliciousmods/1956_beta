 uruguay.1.t:0 "Disappearance Of Gabriel Terra"
 uruguay.1.d:0 "Two days ago, Gabriel Terra went on a diplomatic visit to Argentina, mainly in connection with a revision of certain trade treaties between the two nations, following the adoption of a more protectionist policy by the new government, initiated in particular by Vice-President Luis Alberto de Herrera.\nOn the night of his return, around two in the morning, contacts with the plane supposed to take the president back to Uruguay were lost.\nThe wreck was found the next day, right in the middle of the Rio Negro. No passengers survived.\n\nAs the country recovers from the shock of losing the President who allowed Uruguay to emerge from the Great Depression and modernized the political system by allying Uruguay's two main political parties, Luis Alberto de Herrera is preparing to assume Uruguay's presidency."

 URG_the_terra_dictatorship_desc:0 "In March 1933, with the support of the police, the army, and a large part of the Partido Nacional, Gabriel Terra formed a coup d'état, dissolving parliament and disbanding the National Council of Administration. This was followed by the abolition of the constitution and strong censorship of the press, and formed a government composed of conservatives and anti-liberals, which would put in place the 1934 constitution."
 URG_axis_loans:0 "Axis Loans"
 URG_axis_loans_desc:0 "It is obvious that the United States and Great Britain are and will remain our main trading partners, but we could extend our trade opportunities by reaching out to the European fascist nations, and in particular to Italy and Germany. In exchange, they made us a loan with no return, which we can use in our construction projects."
 URG_western_commercial_relations:0 "Western Commercial Relations"
 URG_western_commercial_relations_desc:0 "Recently, we have finished paying our debt to England, and have agreed to buy their coal, which we pay in kind, including with meat. On the American side, a visit by President Roosevelt is planned, in order to strengthen the ties between our two nations."
 URG_suspend_elections:0 "Alliance With Herrera"
 URG_suspend_elections_desc:0 "Terra's work is not yet finished, but cannot continue with a system as limiting as the current Uruguayan constitution is, despite many efforts to strengthen the presidency. We need to create a new one, and get rid of the electoral system to cement his position as a leader."
 URG_new_elections:0 "New Elections"
 URG_pro_fascist_diplomacy:0 "Pro-Fascist Diplomacy"
 URG_pro_fascist_diplomacy_desc:0 "It is clear that European fascist nations would make much better allies than the aging British Empire, or the United States, plunged into crisis. Aligning ourselves with them would ensure Uruguay's safety and prosperity"

 URG_uruguayan_militarism:0 "Uruguayan Militarism"
 URG_uruguayan_militarism_desc:0 "A greater effort must be made to promote military propaganda. Glorification, military parades, nothing must be discarded to allow our people to become a people of soldiers."
 URG_new_elections_desc:0 "It is now time for Terra to withdraw and hold national elections. With all the successes of the previous presidency, the victory of the Colorado Party is assured."
 URG_support_the_allies:0 "Support The Allies"
 URG_support_the_allies_desc:0 "We cannot let Germany threaten trade in South America. The Battle of the River Plate is the last straw. It is now time to break off our diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, and join the fight against them."
 URG_a_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"

 URG_second_revolutionnary_putsch:0 "Second Revolutionnary Putsch"
 URG_second_revolutionnary_putsch_desc:0 "Terra's dictatorship has lasted long enough.

 URG_movimiento_socialista:0 "Follow Frugoni"
 URG_movimiento_socialista_desc:0 "Emilio Frugoni, founder of the Partido Socialista del Uruguay, is a Uruguayan socialist, forced into exile following Terra's takeover.

 URG_communist_party_of_uruguay:0 "Follow The PCU"
 URG_communist_party_of_uruguay_desc:0 "The fall of the Terra dictatorship presents a golden opportunity to bring communism to Uruguay.

 URG_democracy_and_socialism:0 "Democracy And Socialism"
 URG_democracy_and_socialism_desc:0 "The fight against exploitation cannot and must not be fought by tyrannical means, because we would only be falling into a loop that would eventually repeat the mistakes of the previous system. The establishment of a socialist system must always be accompanied by democratic reforms that allow the voice of the people to build the new Uruguay."
 URG_labourism:0 "Labourism"

 URG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While Uruguay was one of the most stable countries in South America, Gabriel Terra's coup d'état was a shock to the small nation. The persecutions brought about by the regime forced many politicians and intellectuals to flee, particularly towards Argentina.\n\nHowever, the dictatorship is far from being entrenched, with a first revolutionary coup attempt in 1935, which may well not be the last."
