 vietnam.3.t:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 vietnam.3.d:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has negatively responded to a military alliance between our two countries.

 vietnam.3.a:0 "We can only count on ourselves."

 vietnam.4.t:0 "Communists Attempt Coup!"
 vietnam.4.d:0 "Numerous militias loyal to the Malayan Races Liberation Army, itself affiliated with the Malayan Communist Party, have just deployed in Singapore and hope to take control of the colonial government to destroy the [ENG.GetAdjective] administration and establish a communist regime.\nForces loyal to the government, stationed outside the city, are preparing to take it back, but nothing guarantees their victory."
 vietnam.4.a:0 "The coup succeeds."
 vietnam.4.b:0 "The Coup fails."

 vietnam.5.t:0 "The [MAL.GetAdjective] Coup has Failed!"
 vietnam.5.d:0 "Communist forces could not defend Singapore and were eventually defeated after a long battle. Many cadres of the Malayan Communist Party were captured or killed, destroying our chances of installing communism in Malaysia from within."
 vietnam.5.a:0 "We shall avenge our brothers!"

 vietnam.6.t:0 "Help from the South"
 vietnam.6.d:0 "Kuomintang and VNQDD have always been allies, each wishing to follow the teachings of Sun-Yat-Sen. VNQDD cadres have been protected in [CHI.GetNameDef] for years, sheltered from the [FRA.GetAdjective] police.\nAs [CHI.GetNameDef] finds itself in a state of war again, the [VIN.GetAdjective] government has sent us a request to help us."

 vietnam.9.d:0 "Nguyen Ai Quoc, better known by his nickname of Ho-Chi-Minh, leader of the Viet-Minh and the Vietnamese resistance to colonialism, trained in Marxist and Leninist ideas while in the Soviet Union before returning to guide the rebellion against the colonial administration.

 vietnam.9.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 vietnam.10.t:0 "La Lutte's Leadership"
 vietnam.10.d:0 "Ta Thu Thau, leader of "La Lutte", who had been working for months to organize a real socialist opposition to [FRA.GetAdjective] colonization, found himself and his Trotskyist colleagues leading the rebellion that liberated Vietnam. Seen as a figure of hope and freedom, he has attracted the support of both farmers and urban workers, making him the obvious choice to lead our nation."
 vietnam.10.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 vietnam.11.t:0 "VNQDD Leadership"
 vietnam.11.d:0 "Nguyen Tuong Tam, leader of the VNQDD, one of the oldest and most active parties advocating Vietnam's independence, has managed to restore the power that his party had lost in the past by rebuilding it after the French administration had almost destroyed it. The leader of the rebellion, he has succeeded in taking over the leadership of the uprising.

Helped mainly by the powerful elites who turned around following the victory of the independentists, the latter has a vision of Vietnam that is very specific to him while being inspired by regimes like [JAP.GetNameDef], where the latter has managed to gain enough support to help him in the War of Independence."
 vietnam.12.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 vietnam.13.t:0 "A Divided Leadership"
 vietnam.13.d:0 "The forces fighting for Vietnam's independence were many, each with radically different ideas than the others, making long-term cooperation simply impossible. Now that the war is over, only one can win."

 vietnam.13.b:0 "La Lutte and the Trotskyists!"
 vietnam.13.c:0 "The VNQDD!"

 VIN_three_together_system:0 "The Three Together System"
 VIN_three_together_system_desc:0 "The "Three Together System" is the act of sending party officials to live in landless peasant villages, working together, eating together, and living together.

 VIN_cement_rule_in_the_villages:0 "Cement Rule in the Villages"
 VIN_cement_rule_in_the_villages_desc:0 "In Vietnam, there is a saying called 'Phep Vua Thua Le Lang', literally meaning that the emperor is secondary to village customs and implicitly indicating that national rule at the village was given away to autonomous management by the village itself. If we wish to maintain the government authority, it is necessary to bring all the villages under the supreme control of the government."
 VIN_land_reforms_program:0 "Land Reform Program"
 VIN_land_reforms_program_desc:0 "It is now time to enact legislation that will allow us to implement our land reform program. It will take place province by province, and a Central Land Reform Committee will oversee it."
 VIN_begin_the_five_years_plan:0 "Begin the Five Year Plan"
 VIN_begin_the_five_years_plan_desc:0 "The economy can only develop if it is centralized under the party. To build socialism in Vietnam, we need to launch an effective nationwide industrialization plan."

 VIN_woo_the_stalinists_desc:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] is our natural ally.

 VIN_the_permanent_siege:0 "The Permanent Siege"
 VIN_the_permanent_siege_desc:0 "We are isolated from the rest of our communist brothers. [PRC.GetLeader] is isolated in the mountains while an ocean separates us from [SOV.GetNameDef].

 VIN_intervene_in_chineses_affairs_desc:0 "Our [PRC.GetAdjective] comrades were a great help and a source of inspiration for Ho Chi Minh. However, Kuomintang reactionaries continue to chase them away and repress them. It is time to intervene and save our brothers."

 VIN_invite_soviet_industrial_experts_desc:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s transformed Russia from a peasant nation into an industrial monster through radical reforms carried out by competent people.

 VIN_create_the_hanoi_group:0 "Create the Hanoi Group"
 VIN_create_the_hanoi_group_desc:0 "Truong Chinh proposed a great idea to make up for our scientific backwardness: creating a large scientific center in Hanoi welcoming any scientist adhering to socialist ideals. We could then pass on these technological advances to our other communist allies."

 VIN_formalise_the_alliance_desc:0 "The victory of the communists in China is assured. It is now time to sign an alliance treaty with them and launch the final battle to eliminate the [CHI.GetAdjective] reactionary forces once and for all."
 VIN_anti_japanese_aim:0 "Anti-Japanese Focus"
 VIN_anti_japanese_aim_desc:0 "[JAP.GetNameDefCap] is a nation hungry for blood, power, and conquest. They have subjugated Korea, Manchuria, and soon all of Asia.

 VIN_political_reorganisation_of_the_army_desc:0 "The army is necessary to protect and spread the revolution.

 VIN_minimal_socialist_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The excessive bureaucracy, characteristic of the Stalinist regimes, transforms them into a simple disguised hierarchy.

 VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy:0 "Encourage Inter-Party Democracy"
 VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy_desc:0 "Despite having a single revolutionary party, it must be open to different ways of approaching and developing Vietnamese socialism.

 VIN_a_gun_in_every_hand:0 "A Gun in Every Hand..."
 VIN_a_gun_in_every_hand_desc:0 "Much of the revolution must be led by the people themselves. To help them fight against capitalist exploitation, everyone will have the right to own a firearm and train their militias to defend revolutionary ideas."

 VIN_a_factory_in_every_city:0 "...And A Factory In Every City"
 VIN_a_factory_in_every_city_desc:0 "Only the workers can achieve revolution. Farmers are far too dependent on landowners and thus will have much more difficulty rejecting capitalism. Developing our industry through public works will help to increase the working population."

 VIN_the_vnqdd_in_power:0 "The VNQDD in Power"

 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments:0 "Establish the Regional Parliaments"
 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments_desc:0 "An excellent way to help local representation would be to create a parliament for Vietnam's three regions: Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin. This parliament would be just below the federal parliament in terms of power and could take decisions, particularly on the budget."
 VIN_build_the_quang_bich_line:0 "Build the Quand Bich Line"
 VIN_build_the_quang_bich_line_desc:0 "The confrontation against [JAP.GetNameDef] will occur mainly on land, but they may also attempt naval invasions, accentuated by our much smaller naval force. We will implement a coastal fortification program to prevent amphibious invasion."
