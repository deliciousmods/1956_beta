indonesia.1.t:0 "An Offer from the East Indies"
indonesia.1.desc:0 "While the main city of Singapore is well defended, it is no secret that a more significant naval presence is needed to protect our east Asian colonies. A communique from the colonial government of the East Indies has given us an interesting opportunity; air supplies for military access. Should we accept?"
indonesia.1.a:0 "Capital!"
indonesia.1.b:0 "Our current defenses suit us just fine, thank you."
indonesia.4.t:0 "East Indies Naval Autonomy?"
indonesia.4.desc:0 "While our current naval position in the East Indies is secured, our shipyards are far away from Java. The colonial government has requested naval autonomy and command of a squadron of our ships to counter this. Should we allow their request?"
indonesia.4.a:0 "Very well."
indonesia.4.b:0 "We cannot afford to lose a single ship."
indonesia.5.t:0 "[HOL.GetNameDefCap] Agrees!"
indonesia.5.desc:0 "Whether by apathy or sincere belief in our efforts, the [HOL.GetAdjective] government has granted us limited naval autonomy in our region."

indonesia.8.desc:0 "While nationalistic sympathies have been running high in our colonies, the colonial government we have in place has managed to placate the native population and keep it relativly content. However, there is still many extremists and radicals among the nationalist and pro-independence ranks that have called for, if not complete freedom, increased autonomy for the East Indies. Thus the Soetardjo Petition was drawn just some days ago in the Volksraad and made it's way here."
indonesia.8.a:0 "A small price to pay for stability."
indonesia.8.b:0 "The situation as it stands works fine for us."
indonesia.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
indonesia.9.desc:0 "After, most likely, fierce and fiery debates over the Soetardjo Petition, it has been decided that [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] shall achieve higher or even full autonomy within the Commonwealth of the Netherlands. This has proved to be a great success and there is, of course, somebody to thank for this, that being Soetardjo Kartohadikusumo, leader of the Native Civil Servants Association and all of his supporters."
indonesia.9.a:0 "Another step towards freedom!."
indonesia.54.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejects"
indonesia.54.desc:0 "After, most likely, fierce and fiery debates over the Soetardjo Petition, it has been decided that [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] shall retain it's current administrative and colonial position within the Commonwealth of the Netherlands. It appeares that [FROM.GetNameDef] strives to maintain the status quo within [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] and posibly other colonies, fearing that accepting might be a show of weakness."
indonesia.54.a:0 "At least they gave us an answer."

indonesia.10.t:0 "Freedom for the East Indies?"
indonesia.10.desc:0 "Nationalistic sympathies have run high in our colonies and reached a breaking point. Democratic agitators in the East Indies have begun demanding free elections and freedom from colonial control but are willing for an alliance in the future. How do we react?"
indonesia.10.a:0 "Better them than the communists."

indonesia.40.desc:0 "The world has changed vastly since the Great War, and the time of colonial empires has become quite old-fashioned. The recently independent [FROM.GetName] is a prime example of the struggle of the native people under colonial rule for freedom and independence. Diplomats from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government and administration have pleaded and petitoned for us to allow our colonial holdings in Southeast Asia independence in exchange for a guarantee of [INS.GetAdjective] protection. What should we make of this offer?"
indonesia.40.a:0 "This might be in everyone's best interests..."
indonesia.40.c:0 "Our colonial holdings are of great strategic and economic importance, we shall not accept."
indonesia.41.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agrees To Our Petition!"
indonesia.41.desc:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to withdraw it's military forces and diplomats from their colonial holdings in Southeast Asia. Most likely due to [ROOT.GetAdjective] pressure, they are inclined to believe that this might actually be in everyone's best interests as they wouldn't like [ROOT.GetNameDef] as their enemy in the region. Nonetheless, this marks yet another step towards the freedom of Asian peoples!"
indonesia.41.a:0 "A victory of diplomacy!"

The end of colonialism is near, our independece marks just another step towards it!"
indonesia.42.a:0 "Glory to the liberation of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] peoples!"
indonesia.42.b:0 "Our future lies with [OVERLORD.GetNameDef]..."
indonesia.45.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
indonesia.45.desc:0 "Despite our good intentions, our petition has fallen on deaf ears. [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has no plans on relinquishing control over it's colonial holdings within Southeast Asia. Sadly, colonialism and imperialism live yet another day!"

indonesia.100.desc:0 "Now that we are independent, a good first step in showcasing our autonomy would be changing the names of some of our cities. [HOL.GetADjective] influence has no place in our new nation."
indonesia.100.a:0 "It shall be done!"

indonesia.105.t:0 "The New Governor"
indonesia.105.desc:0 "The retirement of Cornelis de Jonge as Governor-general of the East Indies marks the end of an era. A strong, stubborn man, Jonge was firmly opposed to local autonomy and was also firmly pro-Dutch in his administration, rejecting most efforts to increase colonial autonomy. His replacement, Stachouwer, has yet to decide which way he will point the administration, but many are hoping for a breath of fresh air to kickstart independence movements."
indonesia.105.a:0 "May he govern well."

indonesia.107.t:0 "The First Sila"
indonesia.107.desc:0 "The Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence has created a draft of the guiding principles of our fledgling country known as the Pancasila or the Five Principles. However, they have reached a disagreement on what would be the first Sila. Incidentally, this would determine the place of Islam within the government. Some push for the implementation of Shariah for Muslims, while others would like to go further and hold every citizen accountable based on their respective religions. A minority among the Committee has also stated their desire for a secular Indonesia and another a monarchist one. After careful deliberation, the Committee has decided that the first Sila would be..."
indonesia.107.a:0 "...to follow the Sharia and walk with Allah."
indonesia.107.c:0 "...to honor God, Sultan, and Country."
indonesia.107.d:0 "...what the secularists propose."

INS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Indonesia may seem to be a stable colony for the inattentive observer, but the situation is much tenser for those living there. The colonial regime is maintained by a mix of repression of the natives while maintaining close ties to their aristocracy. But since the beginning of the century, nationalist organizations have started to appear and demand more autonomy and rights. Most radicals demand the end of colonial rule and are looking for support through revolutionary ideologies."
