 #EVENTS
 ################################
 israel.1.t:0 "Irgun Coup!"
 israel.1.d:0 "Forced to cooperate together during the recent war, The Haganah and Irgun reluctantly fought side by side to secure the country's independence. Now however, with our independence secure for the time being, the disorganized army has fragmented once more. With tensions at an all time high, a conflict between Haganah and Irgun soldiers in Tel Aviv escalated into a country-wide coup, with the Irgun succesfully taking over control."
 israel.1.a:0 "[ISR.GetNeutralLeader] will lead us to glory!"

 israel.2.t:0 "Ze'ev Jabotinsky Passes Away"
 israel.2.d:0 "Earlier today, Ze'ev Jabotinsky suffered a fatal heart attack. Mourners over the nation gathered at his funeral at Herzl Mountain Cemetary, even with some Mapai members showing up aswell. His successor, Menachem Begin, pledges to continue his legacy as leader of Hatsohar."
 israel.2.a:0 "End of an era."

 israel.3.t:0 "The Capital Question"
 israel.3.d:0 "After relocating the capital during the War of Independence, it is time to settle once and for all what the capital of the new Jewish state should be. Many secular groups believe it should stay as the secular hub of Tel Aviv, while more religious communites believe it should be returned to the Holy City of Jerusalem. What shall we chose?"
 israel.3.a:0 "The capital shall stay in Tel Aviv."
 israel.3.b:0 "The capital will be moved back to Jerusalem."

 israel.4.t:0 "The Sixth Aliyah"
 israel.4.d:0 "With the independence of the new state, Jewish refugees from the entire world flock to the new country for refuge, fleeing from the growing horrors of fascism and anti-semetism in Europe and the world. This has created an immigration crisis of massive proportions, however we cannot afford to turn anyone down, as our nation would benefit immensily from a population influx."
 israel.4.a:0 "As between collapsing walls the people sang."

 israel.5.t:0 "The Provisional Elections"
 israel.5.d:0 "After convening the Knesset, it is time for our first elections. On the left, Ya'akov Hazan's Democratic-Socialist Hashomer Hatsiar party, advocating for closer cooperation with the Soviet Union. On the centre, David Ben-Gurion's Social-Democratic Mapai advocates for an alliance with the west and a pragmatic foreign policy, and on the right there is [ISR.GetNeutralLeader]'s Hatzohar, callling for the formation of an independent Greater Israel on both banks of the Jordan. The country awaits with bated breath to see who will lead it through it's most crucial years."
 israel.5.a:0 "Ya'akov Hazan will lead us to a brighter future!"
 israel.5.b:0 "David Ben-Gurion will lead us to a stable country!"

 israel.6.t:0 "Hardliners Gaining Influence"
 israel.6.d:0 "Reports have been coming in recently of the Hardliner faction trying to gain more political influence. Some say they are trying to overthrow us, but others claim they are our allies and are trustworthy. What shall we do?"
 israel.6.a:0 "Nonsense. They are our allies."
 israel.6.b:0 "Purge them immediatly. This will not be tolerated."

 israel.7.t:0 "Hardliner Takeover"
 israel.7.d:0 "Today, Hardliners stormed the Knesset building and took over the government. [ISR.GetNeutralLeader] was shot during the commotion, such as other members of Hatzohar. [ISR.GetFascistLeader] announced today the beginning of a new Israeli state, one that will reclaim our lost glory."
 israel.7.a:0 "They were fools for trusting us."

 israel.8.t:0 "[ISR.GetNameDefCap] Demands Jordan"
 israel.8.d:0 "Today, [ISR.GetLeader] made a formal demand that we surrender the territories of Jordan to their Greater Israel. They claim the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people is on both banks of the Jordan river, and that the territory is rightfully theres."
 israel.8.a:0 "They might be insane, but we cannot afford a war right now."
 israel.8.b:0 "Preposterous. Have they lost their minds?"
 
 israel.9.t:0 "Jordan Ceded"
 israel.9.d:0 "[455.controller.GetNameDefCap] has ceded control of Jordan to us following our demands. Our Greater Israel is finally united."
 israel.9.a:0 "Only Thus."
  
 israel.10.t:0 "[455.controller.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Demands"
 israel.10.d:0 "Today, [455.controller.GetLeader] has issued a message to us ridiculing us for demanding Jordan from them. They claim that we have gone insane for such demands."
 israel.10.a:0 "Maybe some day."
 israel.10.b:0 "We have no choice."
 
 israel.11.t:0 "Loss In The Sinai War"
 israel.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, due to our incompetence and our failure to recapture the Sinai from Israel, we are now being asked to concede and sign a peace treaty. Continuing the war could prove disasterous for our nation's stability."
 israel.11.a:0 "It is the best for the Egyptian people, we must accept."
 israel.11.b:0 "No! We mustn't take humiliation!"
 israel.12.t:0 "Victory Against Israel"
 israel.12.d:0 "Following the daring invasion of the Sinai by the Israeli forces, they have issued a peace offering, as their operation cannot bear any entrance to their land, nor the failure to capture the sinai. Truly, god is on our side."
 israel.12.a:0 "We are victorious!"
 israel.12.b:0 "No! We must push further!"
