 ISR_DBG_DESCRIPTION:0 "David Josef Gruen always believed that he would be the one to succeed Herzl as the leader of the Zionist cause. Many called him delusional or a madman, however he would embrace Herzl's dictum - If you will it, it is no dream.\n\nBorn in 1886 in what would now become Plock to a family of poor and uneducated farmers, Gruen would take an interest in Zionism at a young age. Joining Poali Zion after the Kishinev pogrom, he would go on to become a high ranking member of the party, on several occasions meeting with Jewish leaders such as Ber Borochov.\n\nAfter Borochov's departure to America, Gruen would go on to move to Palestine, where he would be recruited by Yisrael Shochat's Palestine branch of Poali Zion. Shochat believed that Gruen would be a useful tool for him, while in reality Gruen would take every oppertunity to gain power in the party. To counterbalance this, Shochat recruited newly arrived Yitshak Ben-Zvi to the party to counterbalance Gruen. Gruen and Ben-Zvi would end up becoming good friends, however he would slowly lose power in the party to Ben-Zvi and Shochat. Fed up, he resigned from the party and moved to Sejera, where he would finally adopt a Hebrew name: Ben-Gurion.\n\nApon the outbreak of the Great War, Ben-Gurion would rejoin Ben-Zvi in Poali Zion to rally support for the Ottoman Empire, hoping to gain the approval of the imperial government. However, he was met with rejection when the government declared Poali Zion an anti-Turkish organization and deported all of it's members to Egypt, where they would spend the rest of the war, some joining forces with the British to fight against the Ottomans.\n\nWith the newly formed Mandate under British control, Ben-Gurion would go on to form a new party: Mapai, and it's paramilitary force, the Haganah. This party would go on to dominate the Yishuv's leadership, and when the time came to launch a revolt against the British, it was the Haganah who struck first.\n\nNow, with the hope of 2000 years finally within reach, it is the job of none other than Ben-Gurion to cross the finish line."

 #EVENTS

 israel.1.t:0 "Irgun Coup!"
 israel.1.d:0 "Forced to cooperate together during the recent war, The Haganah and Irgun reluctantly fought side by side to secure the country's independence. Now however, with our independence secure for the time being, the disorganized army has fragmented once more. With tensions at an all time high, a conflict between Haganah and Irgun soldiers in Tel Aviv escalated into a country-wide coup, with the Irgun successfully taking over control."
 israel.1.a:0 "[ISR.GetNeutralLeader] will lead us to glory!"

 israel.2.t:0 "Ze'ev Jabotinsky Passes Away"
 israel.2.d:0 "Earlier today, Ze'ev Jabotinsky suffered a fatal heart attack. Mourners over the nation gathered at his funeral at Herzl Mountain Cemetary, even with some Mapai members showing up as well. His successor, Menachem Begin, pledges to continue his legacy as leader of Hatzohar."
 israel.2.a:0 "End of an era."

 israel.3.t:0 "The Capital Question"
 israel.3.d:0 "After relocating the capital during the War of Independence, it is time to settle once and for all what the capital of the new Jewish state should be. Many secular groups believe it should stay as the secular hub of Tel Aviv, while more religious communities believe it should be returned to the Holy City of Jerusalem. What shall we chose?"
 israel.3.a:0 "The capital shall stay in Tel Aviv."
 israel.3.b:0 "The capital will be moved back to Jerusalem."

 israel.4.t:0 "The Sixth Aliyah"
 israel.4.d:0 "With the independence of the new state, Jewish refugees from the entire world flock to the new country for refuge, fleeing from the growing horrors of fascism and anti-semitism in Europe and the world. This has created an immigration crisis of massive proportions, however we cannot afford to turn anyone down, as our nation would benefit immensely from a population influx."
 israel.4.a:0 "As between collapsing walls the people sang."

 israel.5.t:0 "The Provisional Elections"
 israel.5.d:0 "With the end of the war, the time for our first elections has come. After holding a national census, for which the entire country had to be put in curfew for 5 hours, we are finally ready.\n\nCitizens all over the nation flock to the polls to vote for their parties, and the race is close. Time will tell who the victor will be."
 israel.5.a:0 "The people of Yisrael truly live once more."

 israel.6.t:0 "Hardliners Gaining Influence"
 israel.6.d:0 "Reports have been coming in recently of the Hardliner faction trying to gain more political influence. Some say they are trying to overthrow us, but others claim they are our allies and are trustworthy. What shall we do?"
 israel.6.a:0 "Nonsense. They are our allies."
 israel.6.b:0 "Purge them immediately. This will not be tolerated."

 israel.7.t:0 "Hardliner Takeover"
 israel.7.d:0 "Today, Hardliners stormed the Knesset building and took over the government. [ISR.GetNeutralLeader] was shot during the commotion, such as other members of Hatzohar. [ISR.GetFascistLeader] announced today the beginning of a new Israeli state, one that will reclaim our lost glory."
 israel.7.a:0 "They were fools for trusting us."

 israel.8.t:0 "[ISR.GetNameDefCap] Demands Jordan"
 israel.8.d:0 "Today, [ISR.GetLeader] made a formal demand that we surrender the territories of Jordan to their Greater Israel. They claim the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people is on both banks of the Jordan river, and that the territory is rightfully theres."
 israel.8.a:0 "They might be insane, but we cannot afford a war right now."
 israel.8.b:0 "Preposterous. Have they lost their minds?"
 
 israel.9.t:0 "Jordan Ceded"
 israel.9.d:0 "[455.controller.GetNameDefCap] has ceded control of Jordan to us following our demands. Our Greater Israel is finally united."
 israel.9.a:0 "Only Thus."
  
 israel.10.t:0 "[455.controller.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Demands"
 israel.10.d:0 "Today, [455.controller.GetLeader] has issued a message to us ridiculing us for demanding Jordan from them. They claim that we have gone insane for such demands."
 israel.10.a:0 "Maybe some day."
 israel.10.b:0 "We have no choice."
 
 israel.11.t:0 "Loss In The Sinai War"
 israel.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, due to our incompetence and our failure to recapture the Sinai from Israel, we are now being asked to concede and sign a peace treaty. Continuing the war could prove disasterous for our nation's stability."
 israel.11.a:0 "It is the best for the Egyptian people, we must accept."
 israel.11.b:0 "No! We mustn't take humiliation!"
 israel.12.t:0 "Victory Against Israel"
 israel.12.d:0 "Following the daring invasion of the Sinai by the Israeli forces, they have issued a peace offering, as their operation cannot bear any entrance to their land, nor the failure to capture the sinai. Truly, god is on our side."
 israel.12.a:0 "We are victorious!"
 israel.12.b:0 "No! We must push further!"
 
 israel.15.t:0 "Yom Ha'Atsmaut"
 israel.15.d:0 "Yom Ha'Atsmaut - Independence Day. Our people's dream of 2000 years, to finally be a free people in our own land, has finally been achieved. Celebrations have bursted out across the entire nation as the armistice has been signed, with the people finally believing that all their hard work has paid off.\n\nBut this is not the end. Now, it is time to come together and rebuild, Jew and Arab alike. We may have gained a spot on the world stage, but we must make sure we keep it."
 israel.15.a:0 "Am Yisrael Hai!"

 israel.16.t:0 "Aliyah Struggles Ease"
 israel.16.d:0 "Over the past couple years since our independence, our nation's infrastructure has been stressed by the Aliyah immigration wave that we were hit with. However, with the expansion of our industry and the growing political legitimacy of our nation, the crippling effects of the Aliyah are slowly improving."
 israel.16.a:0 "As between collapsing walls the people sang."
 
 israel.20.t:0 "Choosing the President of Israel"
 israel.20.d:0 "With the Knesset convened, we must decide on a figurehead to lead our nation as President. There are many suggestions, but it mostly boils down to three. Chaim Weizmann, the Yishuv's representative at the treaty of Sevres, Yitshak Ben-Zvi, a longtime Labour Zionist and friend of David Ben-Gurion, and Albert Einstein, a leading Jewish figure known across the entire world.\n\nThe Knesset is split, many are saying Einstein is the right choice, while others say that the chance of him accepting is low and he might be too inexperienced with politics, which is why Weizmann or Ben-Zvi are the better choice."
 israel.20.a:0 "Chaim Weizmann has been a figurehead since Zionism's inception. He is the obvious choice."
 israel.20.b:0 "Yitshak Ben-Zvi has proved his dedication. We must choose him."
 israel.20.c:0 "We need scientific thought to propel our nation. Einstein is the right decision."
 israel.21.t:0 "Einstein Resigns"
 israel.21.d.a:0 "President Einstein made a speech today in which he claims that due to the current government's reliance on religious parties, he can no longer serve as the President of the nation due to conflicting interests. Former presidential candidate Chaim Weizmann has been selected to take his position."
 israel.21.d.b:0 "President Einstein made a speech today in which he claims that due to the current government's authoritarian policies, he can no longer serve as the President of the nation due to conflicting interests. Former presidential candidate Chaim Weizmann has been selected to take his position."
 israel.21.a:0 "He was not fit for the office anyway."

 israel.22.t:0 "Jerusalem Armistice Talks"
 israel.22.d.a:0 "Following the Jordanian invasion of the West Bank, we are put in a position where we must negotiate an official armistice line for Jerusalem with [JOR.GetNameDef]. The city will be divided between our nations to hopefully lower tensions."
 israel.22.d.b:0 "Following our invasion of the West Bank, we are put in a position where we must negotiate an official armistice line for Jerusalem with [ISR.GetNameDef]. The city will be divided between our nations to hopefully lower tensions."
 israel.22.a:0 "We will reluctantly come to a compromise."

 israel.23.t:0 "Returning Herzl's Body"
 israel.23.d:0 "The great Zionist visionary, Theodore Herzl, who founded the very idea of a modern Jewish state, currently lays at rest in his home of Vienna. However, in his will, the great father of Zionism stated that his and his family's remains should be moved to the Land of Israel when the Jewish people earned their freedom. That time is now.\n\nHowever, we must get [4.controller.GetNameDef] to agree to this, as they currently control his resting place. Should we attempt to negotiate with them?"
 israel.23.a:0 "The father of Zionism must be put to rest."
 israel.23.b:0 "He shall remain where he is."

 israel.24.t:0 "[ISR.GetNameDefCap] Requests Return of Herzl's Body"
 israel.24.d:0 "[ISR.GetNameDefCap] has recently come to our government in an attempt to relocate Zionist leader and visionary Theodore Herzl's remains from Vienna to Israel. We must decide if we are to grant this request."
 israel.24.a:0 "They may have his body."
 israel.24.b:0 "He will remain here."
 
 israel.25.t:0 "Herzl's Body Returned"
 israel.25.d.a:0 "[4.controller.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to return Herzl's body to us. a Cemetary for all great Zionist leaders is being created in Jerusalem, and he will be put to rest there."
 israel.25.d.b:0 "[4.controller.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to return Herzl's body to us. a Cemetary for all great Zionist leaders is being created in Tel Aviv, and he will be put to rest there."
 israel.25.a:0 "If you will it, it is no dream."

 israel.26.t:0 "[4.controller.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Return Herzl's Body"
 israel.26.d:0 "We have been met with rejection from [4.controller.GetNameDef] for our request to return Herzl's body. He will remain there for the time being."
 israel.26.a:0 "This will not be forgotten."

 israel.27.t:0 "Arab Civilians Flee"
 israel.27.d:0 "Following the reality of our victory becoming more and more apparent, many Arab civilians have fled from our territories into neighboring countries. We will have to decide how we will handle this situation."
 israel.27.a:0 "Expected."


 israel.30.t:0 "Elections in the West Bank"
 israel.30.d:0 "With our preparations towards holding our first elections, we must answer the question: Will elections be held in the West Bank? If they are held, the significant Arab majority in the area will definitely tip the election results towards the left-wing parties. We must make a choice."
 israel.30.a:0 "They are citizens as much as anyone else. It will be done."
 israel.30.b:0 "We cannot trust them to vote just yet."

 israel.31.t:0 "The Aging Father"
 israel.31.d:0 "Prime Minister Ben-Gurion has expressed multiple times his will to retire from politics and form a Kibbutz in the Negev. Many believe he deserves a well earned rest, but others believe we need his leadership in these times. In the event that he would resign, foreign minister Moshe Sharett will take his place.\n\nWhat should be done?"
 israel.31.a:0 "No man has sacrificed more than him. Let him rest."
 israel.31.b:0 "We need his leadership."
 
 israel.32.t:0 "Drafting a Constitution"
 israel.32.d:0 "The dream of an independent Jewish nation is fulfilled, and the doubters are silent. Our troubles are not over though. Our nation lacks a constitution that determines the functions of the government in society, and this can cause major issues if not addressed. However, there are many controversial issues that must be addressed, and it might be difficult to come out with a concise agreement.\n\n§OIn order to pass the constitution, we must make sure it has a majority of votes, but also is not too vague, and must address certain issues, even if some parties might be against the verdict.§!"
 israel.32.a:0 "Let the negotiations begin."

 israel.33.t:0 "The Question of Conscription" 
 israel.33.d:0 "The first dilemma of the constitutional negotiations deals with conscription. Currently, many religious communities in Israel receive special exemptions from military service due to religious beliefs, something the secular majority is infuriated by.\n\nShould they be forced to serve?"
 israel.33.a:0 "They must serve as anyone else."
 israel.33.b:0 "They have a reason not to."

 israel.34.t:0 "The Question of Shabbat"
 israel.34.d:0 "The second dilemma of the constitutional negotiations revolves around the role of Shabbat in our nation. Some demand that all services and businesses must be closed on Shabbat, while others say that this is outrageous and that religion must not be coerced on the populace.\n\nWhat should be decided?"
 israel.34.a:0 "Religion cannot be imposed on a populace."
 israel.34.b:0 "If we lose our traditions, are we really Jewish anymore?"
 
 israel.35.t:0 "Question of the Supreme Court"
 israel.35.d:0 "The second dilemma of the constitutional negotiations involves the supreme court. Some believe that we must have a judiciary independent from the Knesset, to act as a counterbalance to the Knesset, while others believe that this is undemocratic and that the Supreme Court cannot be an outside factor."
 israel.35.a:0 "To allow a non elected institute to influence policy would be undemocratic."
 israel.35.b:0 "To allow a majority government to pass any law it wants without a counterbalance would be undemocratic."

 

 israel.39.t:0 "Constitution Negotiations Break Down"
 israel.39.d.a:0 "Due to our failure to keep a majority of the Knesset in support of the constitutional draft, the negotiations have broken down.\n\nWe are left with a small amount of ambiguously binding "Basic Laws" that act as a pseudo-constitution, but these are all too easy to modify and such flimsiness will probably cause issues in the future if we are unable to address this."
 israel.39.d.b:0 "Due to our failure to address many major issues in the constitutional draft, the negotiations have broken down.\n\nWe are left with a small amount of ambiguously binding "Basic Laws" that act as a pseudo-constitution, but these are all too easy to modify and such flimsiness will probably cause issues in the future if we are unable to address this."
 israel.39.a:0 "We can only hope that no major issues will arise."

 israel.40.t:0 "Israeli Access to the Suez Canal?"
 israel.40.d:0 "With our recent nationalization of the Suez canal, the question remains if we should allow Israeli shipping to pass through it. It could easily cripple their access to the eastern world, which would greatly damage them.\n\nHowever, we run the risk of being invaded, as this could be seen as an act of war."
 israel.40.a:0 "Block them from passing."
 israel.40.b:0 "It is too risky."

 israel.41.t:0 "[EGY.GetNameDefCap] Blocks Our Access to the Suez Canal!"
 israel.41.d:0 "With their recent nationalization of the Suez, [EGY.GetNameDef] has blocked our access to the canal. This is a disaster for our shipping to the eastern hemisphere, as our southern port in Eilat is extremely underdeveloped and not connected via rail to the rest of the nation. Fears of an economic collapse linger."
 israel.41.a:0 "We must consider a course of action."

 israel.42.t:0 "The Sinai War"
 israel.42.d:0 "Shortly following [EGY.GetNameDef]'s' nationalization of the Suez Canal, reports of [ISR.GetAdjective] ships being turned around at the canal were spread across the globe.\n\n[ISR.GetLeader] has declared this a cowardly act of war by [EGY.GetLeader] and that due to [EGY.GetNameDef]'s earlier blocking of the Straits of Tiran, [ISR.GetNameDef] has no choice but to invade to prevent itself from being cut off from the eastern world.\n\nReports of clashes on the border have come in, and it seems like war is inevitable."
 israel.42.a:0 "Strike when the iron is hot."

 israel.43.t:0 "Nubian Ibex Spotted" 
 israel.43.d:0 "With the increasing investment into the Negev, many flock to see the local wildlife, including this Nubian Ibex who's photograph was spread around."
 israel.43.a:0 "Truly the most interesting news."

 
 israel.45.t:0 "Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Health Worsening" 
 israel.45.d:0 "While in a meeting with members of the Irgun yesterday, Jabotinsky suddenly collapsed to the ground and was rushed out of the room by medical teams. This recent development supports the theory that he is suffering from a form of heart disease. Many people worry for his health and the fate of the nation if he were to pass away, warning him not to overwork himself."
