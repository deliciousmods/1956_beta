 colombia.1.d:0 "The hot equatorial climate of the Amazonian rainforests in the South of our country, as well as the jungle terrain on the coastal provinces to the West of Cartagena, are creating harsh conditions for the population while proving to be a severe obstacle for our troops in the area, especially in terms of training and military performance.\n\nA few budget cuts allow us to extend our training facilities in jungle areas and appoint the newly recruited commanders of the military academy to their respective posts, for which they were explicitly trained. The jungles of [COL.GetNameDef] shall become our fighting environment where our army, together with guerilla fighters, can fend off the superior enemy."

Should we decline this gesture of "support", [COL.GetAdjective] diplomats threaten us that their military is prepared to cross our border.\n\nWhat should we do?"

Only a strong, unified state such as Gran Colombia can compete with the sleeping giant in the North".\n\nAfter one century, our [VEN.GetAdjective] brothers have gladly accepted, becoming part of the Gran Colombian nation again."

They are preparing their defenses and mobilizing reserves. Even though not all of our soldiers are in position, we shall strike now, as the enemy least expects it.\n\nTo arms, people of [COL.GetNameDef]!
