When war broke out again, he was called back to service. Despite his years (he was born in 1878), he remained fit, healthy and energetic, and had the capacity to apply his incisive mind to whatever the Admiralty saw fit to assign him to.\n\nHistorically, his key contribution was running the escort working-up facility at Tobermory (Tobermory Bay is pictured below with Stephenson), where he and his team put 911 ships through 1,132 training courses. He also played a role coordinating the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, as well as performed as a Commodore on a number of convoys very early in the war.\n\nTobermory under Stephenson's guidance played an important part in the Battle of the Atlantic, getting escorts out to sea quickly and with effective training. Stephenson's innovative but challenging techniques influenced the Royal Navy's post-war working-up procedures, while also earning him the nickname 'The Terror of Tobermory'."
