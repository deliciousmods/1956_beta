 austria.1138.a:0 "Excellent."

 austria.1139.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Has Withheld Slovakia"

 austria.1142.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Has Withheld Krakow"
 austria.1142.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has denied us Krakow, retaining access to the city and denying us ancient Austro-Hungarian land. A questionable decision, for sure."

 austria.1144.a:0 "Just as planned."

 austria.1145.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused Our Deal"
 austria.1145.d:0 "The [ITA.GetAdjective]s have decided that their claim over the Italian majority in Dalmatia is worth more than their dubious claim to the rest of Tyrol. They have refused our offer."

 austria.1152.t:0 "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] Has Succumbed to Our Ultimatum"
 austria.1152.d:0 "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] has wisely accepted our protection offer in these dark and troubled times. Their government has changed hands with minimal fuss to our control, and they will operate as part of our coalition."
 austria.1152.a:0 "The wiser choice to make."

 austria.1153.t:0 "[AUS.GetAdjective] Invitation"
 austria.1153.d:0 "Our old allies, the [AUS.GetAdjective]s, have extended an arm in friendship, offering a resurrection of the Central Powers. Perhaps it is time to rejoin our old Ottoman allies?"

 austria.1156.b:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] cannot be allowed to continue!"

 austria.1157.t:0 "The Ukrainian Armistice"
 austria.1157.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective]s have delivered a peace deal. Considering how the war has been going, the terms are generous - an immediate ceasefire in exchange for freedom for the Russian Ukraine. Should we accept?"
 austria.1157.a:0 "It seems necessary."
 austria.1157.b:0 "Not until the last man is dead!"

 austria.1158.t:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s Have Conceded"

 austria.1160.t:0 "We Have Achieved Our Goals"

 austria.1160.a:0 "Anything to bring democracy to Ukraine."
 austria.1160.b:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s cannot be trusted to remain peaceful."

With [GER.GetAdjective] expansionism on the rise and Europe seemingly moving towards another war, it may be wise to heed their words and seriously consider their offer."
 austria.5006.a:0 "Yes, we must seek allies in the event of another war in Europe."

 austria.5007.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Declines Our Treaty"

 austria.5015.d:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has contacted us with a proposal to solidify and make official our existing defensive pact. Given our recent history of cooperation, this might well be to our mutual advantage."

 austria.5018.t:0 "Transylvanian Ultimatum"
 austria.5018.d:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has demanded of us the return of Transylvania to its rule. They did once rule the region - but the Great War changed that. The threat they pose now, however, is genuine."

 austria.5019.a:0 "Should the pen fail, the sword must be drawn!"

 austria.5020.t:0 "Romanian Nationalists Appear in Transylvania"
 austria.5020.d:0 "Seemingly discontent over the changing of hands from [ROM.GetAdjective] to [AUS.GetAdjective], we notice a genuine threat on the ground in the form of nationalist agitation. This will somewhat hamper our efforts to fully integrate the region."

 austria.5034.t:0 "The Assassination of Kurt Schuschnigg"
 austria.5034.d:0 "According to an official statement by the government of [AUS.GetNameDefCap], Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg was assassinated earlier this morning.\n\nIt is still unclear how the murder transpired, but sources indicate that a communist sympathizer managed to sneak into his private residence and ambush him with an ice axe. As of now, no connection between him and any organized political groups could be established, but the fact that he committed suicide via hidden cyanide pills upon capture hints towards outside assistance.\n\nQuite a few influential communist leaders openly celebrated the death of Schushnigg. Celebratory marches followed by violent riots broke out in Vienna, and it has become apparent that political violence isn't off-limits anymore. Foreign observers fear a rapid escalation leading to something far worse, as [AUS.GetNameDefCap] is now left without a steadfast anti-communist figure in the highest office."

 AUS_support_weapons:0 "Schwarlose M. 7"
 AUS_support_weapons_desc:0 "The Maschinengewehr (Schwarzlose) M. 7, also known as the Schwarzlose MG, is a medium machine-gun used as a standard issue firearm in the Austro-Hungarian Army throughout World War I. It was utilized by the Dutch, Greek, and Hungarian armies during World War II. It was routinely issued to Italian colonial troops, alongside the Mannlicher M1895 rifle."
 AUS_support_weapons2:0 "MG 34"
 AUS_support_weapons2_desc:0 "The versatile MG 34 was arguably the most advanced machine gun globally at the time of its deployment. Its combination of exceptional mobility – being light enough to be carried by one man – and high rate of fire (of up to 900 rounds per minute) was unmatched."
 AUS_support_weapons3:0 "MG 42"
 AUS_support_weapons3_desc:0 "Intended to replace the earlier MG 34, the MG 42 has proven reliability, durability, simplicity, and ease of operation. Still, it is most notable for its ability to produce a high volume of suppressive fire. The MG 42 had one of the highest average cyclic rates of any single-barreled man-portable machine gun: between 1,200 and 1,500 rpm, resulting in a distinctive muzzle report compared to the sound of a power saw or tearing linoleum."
 AUS_support_weapons4:0 "MG 45"
 AUS_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The MG 45 differed from the MG 42 in that it did not wholly lock its breech before firing, increasing its rate of fire and simplifying its construction. In 1945, the material shortages of the Third Reich led to the development of a newer version of the MG 42, the MG 45 (or MG 42V). The tested MG 45/42V fired 120,000 rounds in succession at a rate of fire around 1,350 rounds per minute."
