 austria.1111.t:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective] Compromise"
 austria.1111.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective] government has heard the word of our campaign for Anschluss of our two great nations and offered a compromise - support in any future war, for autonomy in the meantime."
 austria.1111.a:0 "They will be valuable as an autonomous ally."

 austria.1113.d:0 "The [GER.GetAdjective]s have decided that the unification of the Central Powers is the only way forward, and it seems that we are not part of that plan. Anschluss will go ahead."

 austria.1114.d:0 "For a long time, the countries of Austria and Hungary were united under one emperor. The [AUS.GetAdjective] government has approached us and requested that we reinstate this arrangement."

 austria.1117.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Demands Transylvania"
 austria.1117.d:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has been making statements amongst its people and ours about the importance of Transylvania to the [HUN.GetAdjective] people. If we wish to avoid war, it has come to the breakpoint - do we cede Transylvania?"
 austria.1117.a:0 "Transylvania is rightfully ours!"
 austria.1117.b:0 "If we go to war, they will just take everything."
 
 austria.1118.t:0 "Romania Has Yielded"
 austria.1118.d:0 "The [ROM.GetAdjective]s have displayed unusual wisdom in ceding Transylvania as demanded. The local governmental infrastructure is already being transferred to our control, and we can move troops in as needed."
 austria.1118.a:0 "Perfect."
 
 austria.1119.t:0 "Romania Has Denied Us"
 austria.1119.d:0 "It seems the upstart [ROM.GetAdjective]s have forgotten to whom Transylvania belongs. War with them is justified, but is it the time?"
 austria.1119.a:0 "The fools. Mobilize the troops."
 austria.1119.b:0 "War is inopportune right now. Another time."
 
 austria.1122.t:0 "Transylvania Is Ours"
 austria.1122.d:0 "Transylvania is ours, and we have the opportunity to force an advantageous peace to keep the land we have demanded. This war has already claimed too many lives; should we force a peace deal?"
 austria.1122.a:0 "This war is pointless now."
 austria.1122.b:0 "Push to [ROM.Capital.GetName]!"
 
 austria.1124.t:0 "The Romanian Question"
 austria.1124.d:0 "The Romanian majority in Transylvania has, despite being largely peaceful, kept up stiff political resistance to [HUN.GetAdjective] rule. This is unacceptable. If the majority doesn't accept their authority, we will make them a minority."
 austria.1124.a:0 "Remove them."
 austria.1124.b:0 "Perhaps a bridge too far."
 
 austria.1125.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Demands Slovenia"
 austria.1125.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective] government has been applying political pressure of late for the region of Slovenia. War with them may be costly, but can we afford to cede land so easily?"

 austria.1125.b:0 "Never! [YUG.GetNameDefCap] will defend its own!"

 austria.1126.d:0 "The [YUG.GetAdjective]s have wisely ceded the land we have demanded, granting our troops complete access, as well as control of all facilities. Our plans proceed as required."
 austria.1126.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1127.t:0 "[YUG.GetNameDefCap] Refused Our Demands"
 austria.1127.d:0 "The upstart false-nation of [YUG.GetNameDef] seems to want to fight back against us. What other explanation could we have for so rude a refusal? We will have to take back what is ours."
 austria.1127.a:0 "Then it seems we have no choice."

 austria.1129.t:0 "[YUG.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Our Demands"

 austria.1129.a:0 "We will take what we need."
 austria.1129.b:0 "Now is not the time."
 
 austria.1130.t:0 "[YUG.GetNameDefCap] Cedes the Northern Balkans"
 austria.1130.d:0 "[YUG.GetNameDefCap] recognized that they could not face a war with our superior military and ceded their northern lands. We are already installing our political agents."

 austria.1133.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective] government has requested that the occupied region of Slovakia be transferred to their control in light of its ancestral heritage as Austro-Hungarian land."
 austria.1133.a:0 "This seems reasonable."
 austria.1133.b:0 "It is now [GER.GetAdjective]."
 
 austria.1138.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Has Given Us Slovakia"
 austria.1138.d:0 "The [GER.GetAdjective] government has concluded that we are deserving of a stake in the Slovakian region. They have transferred control of all facilities to us, and we are free to use the land in any way necessary."
 austria.1138.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1139.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Has Withheld Slovakia"
 austria.1139.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has denied our request for the Slovak region. A sad state of affairs, but we will have our day in time."
 austria.1139.a:0 "An unfortunate setback."

 austria.1140.d:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has requested the [POL.GetAdjective] region of Krakow, which has long been contested between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Poland. Their claim is just - but will we grant it?"
 austria.1140.a:0 "Of course."
 austria.1140.b:0 "This does not suit our needs."
 
 austria.1141.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Has Given Us Krakow"
 austria.1141.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has ceded access to the region of Krakow, granting us access to another ancient center of Austro-Hungarian heritage."
 austria.1141.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 austria.1142.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Has Withheld Krakow"
 austria.1142.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has denied us Krakow, retaining access to the city and denying us ancient Austro-Hungarian land. A questionable decision, for sure."
 austria.1142.a:0 "Questionable, but implacable."
 
 austria.1143.t:0 "Dalmatia for South Tyrol"
 austria.1143.d:0 "The political machinations of Italy gained us a part of Tyrol after the Great War. The [AUS.GetAdjective]s intend to reclaim the territory in time - and we want to claim Dalmatia. Perhaps an agreement can be reached?"
 austria.1143.a:0 "It seems necessary."
 austria.1143.b:0 "We will cede them nothing!"
 
 austria.1144.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed to Our Deal"
 austria.1144.d:0 "The [ITA.GetAdjective]s have accepted our offer, agreeing to move their troops out of Dalmatia as we move ours out of Tyrol. The exchange is effective immediately."
 austria.1144.a:0 "Just as planned."
 
 austria.1145.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused Our Deal"
 austria.1145.d:0 "The [ITA.GetAdjective]s have decided that their claim over the Italian majority in Dalmatia is worth more than their dubious claim to the rest of Tyrol. They have refused our offer."
 austria.1145.a:0 "Perhaps for the best."
 
 austria.1146.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] Demands the Istrian Peninsula"
 austria.1146.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective]s have demanded the Istrian peninsula, a stronghold of Austro-Hungarian naval superiority from before the Great War. Denying them could mean consequences."
 austria.1146.a:0 "They are too dangerous a power to deny."
 austria.1146.b:0 "We can deal with consequences."
 
 austria.1147.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Has Ceded Istria"
 austria.1147.d:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] has ceded the old naval stronghold of Istria to us, effective immediately. Our troops are free to reclaim it."
 austria.1147.a:0 "Perfect!"
 
 austria.1148.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused Our Demands"
 austria.1148.d:0 "The [ITA.GetAdjective]s have foolishly stood up to us. Perhaps we must show the upstarts that beating us once does not guarantee victory again."
 austria.1148.a:0 "Are they prepared for war?"
 
 austria.1149.t:0 "[AUS.GetAdjective] Invitation"
 austria.1149.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective] government has extended an invitation to a military alliance headed by their empire. A powerful ally to have - but do we need their help?"
 austria.1149.a:0 "Any help in these unstable times is welcome."
 austria.1149.b:0 "We can forge our own way."
 
 austria.1150.t:0 "[AUS.GetAdjective] Ultimatum"
 austria.1150.d:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has delivered an ultimatum to us - to come under [AUS.GetAdjective] dominion peacefully or be brought under it forcefully. We are placed in a difficult position."
 austria.1150.a:0 "We will protect our citizens' way of life!"
 austria.1150.b:0 "It seems we must accept [AUS.GetAdjective] leadership."
 
 austria.1151.t:0 "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused Our Ultimatum"
 austria.1151.d:0 "The impudent [GRE.GetAdjective]s have delivered a stinging slap to the face, denying our offer of political and military protection. Such an overt gesture is absolutely an act of war!"
 austria.1151.a:0 "And we will treat it as such!"
 
 austria.1152.t:0 "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] Has Succumbed to Our Ultimatum"
 austria.1152.d:0 "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] has wisely accepted our protection offer in these dark and troubled times. Their government has changed hands with minimal fuss to our control, and they will operate as part of our coalition."
 austria.1152.a:0 "The wiser choice to make."
 
 austria.1153.t:0 "[AUS.GetAdjective] Invitation"
 austria.1153.d:0 "Our old allies, the [AUS.GetAdjective]s, have extended an arm in friendship, offering a resurrection of the Central Powers. Perhaps it is time to rejoin our old Ottoman allies?"
 austria.1153.a:0 "If there is any time, it is now."
 austria.1153.b:0 "We must consider our allies more carefully if a war is coming."
 
 austria.1154.t:0 "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed to Join Us"
 austria.1154.d:0 "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer of alliance and stands with us in any future conflict. The Ottomans have not forgotten their friends!"

 austria.1155.t:0 "[TUR.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused to Join Us"
 austria.1155.d:0 "[TUR.GetNameDefCap], it seems, has forgotten how loyally we stood by each other in the Great War. They have denied our alliance and will go their way."
 austria.1155.a:0 "A troubling concept."
 
 austria.1156.t:0 "We Have Beaten Back [SOV.GetNameDef]"
 austria.1156.d:0 "The Ukrainian uprising has been going well, relatively speaking, yet the [SOV.GetAdjective] bear is still a worrying presence above us. We can keep pushing if we believe we can take more ground or deliver a peace deal."
 austria.1156.a:0 "We will offer peace - with conditions."
 austria.1156.b:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] cannot be allowed to continue!"
 
 austria.1157.t:0 "The Ukrainian Armistice"
 austria.1157.d:0 "The [AUS.GetAdjective]s have delivered a peace deal. Considering how the war has been going, the terms are generous - an immediate ceasefire in exchange for freedom for the Russian Ukraine. Should we accept?"
 austria.1157.a:0 "It seems necessary."
 austria.1157.b:0 "Not until the last man is dead!"
 
 austria.1158.t:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s Have Conceded"
 austria.1158.d:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s have accepted a ceasefire. Ukraine is in the hands of the Ukrainians, and the Ukrainians are very grateful to us. A major victory."
 austria.1158.a:0 "And another step in our plans."
 
 austria.1159.t:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s Have Refused"
 austria.1159.d:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s have decided that their interests are better served by a long, grinding war. Evidence of the actual [SOV.GetAdjective] view of the value of the worker, perhaps?"
 austria.1159.a:0 "For the sake of our own, we will end this quickly."
 
 austria.1160.t:0 "We Have Achieved Our Goals"
 austria.1160.d:0 "The Ukrainian uprising has gone well, and a free Ukrainian state is now possible. We can deliver a peace deal to the Soviets - peace, for Ukrainian freedom. A more reasonable offer, we could not make."
 austria.1160.a:0 "Anything to bring democracy to Ukraine."
 austria.1160.b:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s cannot be trusted to remain peaceful."

 AUS_support_weapons:0 "Schwarlose M. 7"
 AUS_support_weapons_desc:0 "The Maschinengewehr (Schwarzlose) M. 7, also known as the Schwarzlose MG, is a medium machine-gun used as a standard issue firearm in the Austro-Hungarian Army throughout World War I. It was utilized by the Dutch, Greek, and Hungarian armies during World War II. It was routinely issued to Italian colonial troops, alongside the Mannlicher M1895 rifle."
 AUS_support_weapons2:0 "MG 34"
 AUS_support_weapons2_desc:0 "The versatile MG 34 was arguably the most advanced machine gun globally at the time of its deployment. Its combination of exceptional mobility – being light enough to be carried by one man – and high rate of fire (of up to 900 rounds per minute) was unmatched."
 AUS_support_weapons3:0 "MG 42"
 AUS_support_weapons3_desc:0 "Intended to replace the earlier MG 34, the MG 42 has proven reliability, durability, simplicity, and ease of operation. Still, it is most notable for its ability to produce a high volume of suppressive fire. The MG 42 had one of the highest average cyclic rates of any single-barreled man-portable machine gun: between 1,200 and 1,500 rpm, resulting in a distinctive muzzle report compared to the sound of a power saw or tearing linoleum."
 AUS_support_weapons4:0 "MG 45"
 AUS_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The MG 45 differed from the MG 42 in that it did not wholly lock its breech before firing, increasing its rate of fire and simplifying its construction. In 1945, the material shortages of the Third Reich led to the development of a newer version of the MG 42, the MG 45 (or MG 42V). The tested MG 45/42V fired 120,000 rounds in succession at a rate of fire around 1,350 rounds per minute."
