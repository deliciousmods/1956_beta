# The officer corps of this brigade was critical. About fifteen officers, including nine 
#commanders, should be trained in Waziristan on India's northwest frontier; since that terrain is 
#similar to that of Tibet, they could learn appropriate tactics there. Junior officers and 
#noncommissioned officers should receive training in Gyantse.  

#Although Gould strongly supported this plan, the Foreign and Political Department of the 
#Government of India was not at all enthusiastic about Gould's urging the Tibetan government 
#to approve Neame's recommendations. In a telegram to the secretary of state for India in 
#London, the department stated that Gould's recommendations for new weapons for Tibet had 
#not been authorized p 287

# The legacy of the military-monastery conflict of the early 1920s still cast its shadow over Tibetan politics. 
#Tibetans made excellent troops when properly led and armed, but the political implications of a 
#modern and efficient army continued to threaten the religious elite and precluded the 
#development of such a force. The Tibetan government continued purposely to maintain an 
#ineffective army.

Therefore the search for the Dalai Lama is the most important task of the regency government in order to ensure the continuity of the theocratic system. The regent just convened the Tibetan National Assembly to decide where to search for the Dalai Lama. In this process two elements were essential: signs and omens would give the government general information on where to look for. Then the visions of the Regent would give more precise information on the location of the next Dalai Lama. He explained that last year, while he was at lake Lhamolatso, he saw the letters "a", "ka" and "ma", a monastery with three-tiered turquoise roof, a gilded pagoda-like top and a twisting trail leading east of this monastery to a bare hill opposite a small one story house with a blue roof. A should mean Amdo (the former Tibetan province in the north-east). This is consistent with the fact that the head of the Dalai Lama turned east after his death. In addition, on the east side of a wooden pillar located in the northeast side of the throneroom, a great star-shaped fungus appeared overnight. In addition, on several different occasions the state oracles Nechung, Gadong, and Samye had flung ceremonial scarves toward the east while in trance. \n\nA part of the assembly is convinced that searching parties must be sent to Amdo, currently under the control of Hui warlords. Others, lead by Lönchen Langdün argue that one of his relative, the son of Yabshi Phawpön, is the Dalai Lama because one of the horses of the stable of the previous Dalai Lama broke loose and ran to his house, as if he was waiting for his master."

It was one of only 17 houses, a rectangular, ground-level building, with its various parts arranged around a wide central courtyard and a rectangular flat roof. There were no openings on the outside walls, except for the doorway. On the roof, there were three chimneys stacks and two air-holes. Around the roof were small gutters with spouts giving out into the courtyard. Over the entrance, there was a socket fixed in the roof to take a 10-foot-high flagpole. \n\nThe search party came there because of the letter "a" seen by the Reting Rinpoche in his vision was referring to the province of Amdo, the letter "ka" certainly meant the monastery of Kumbum. That building was three stories high and roofed by blue tiles, as described by the Regent. The last part of the vision indicated a house with a peculiar tree. Here, finally, they saw a house with a gnarling juniper bush on the flat roof...\n\nIn order to investigate, Kewtsang Rinpoche who was leading the party, disguised himself as a servant while they asked to stay for the night. In it live a couple of peasants and their children, the first one was living at the Kumbum monastery as he had been recognized as the reincarnation of the Taktser Rinpoche. One of those children suddenly recognized him and called him "Sera Lama" multiple times, as if he knew his monastery.
