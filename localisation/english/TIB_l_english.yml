The Lamaist State has had a series of unprecedented democratic reforms in order to open up to the modern world and give the country modern institutions, while their next ruler, the Dalai Lama, is still too young to rule personally. The treaty that was negotiated by the British Mission in Lhasa during the previous months was partially modeled on the treaty of Punakha signed in 1910 between British India and the Royal dynasty of Bhutan. This new treaty shows the determination of the British Government to protect its interests in India, a subject that is more important than ever as China has been in a state of chronic instability since the revolution of 1912."

 himalaya_tibet.3.desc:0 "After our demands of negotiating for a treaty of British protection, Sir Basil Gould responded to us that the British government was willing to maintain good relations with Tibet and wishes us success in our modernization program, but they don't wish to make promises they may not be able to fulfill, and therefore have refused our proposal."
 himalaya_tibet.3.a:0 "We must renounce to our desires."

 himalaya_tibet.7.t:0 "The Great Tibetan Army Review"
 himalaya_tibet.7.desc:0 "For the first time in years, a sizable portion of the army has been assembled in order to practice. It's also the first time since the beginning of the century that a western advisor is present in order to analyze the state of the army and issue guidelines.\n\nTo the surprise of the western expert, some rifles have not been fired in years and it's clear to him that a total reorganization will be necessary. This long process may reinforce the defensive capabilities of Tibet, but the religious elite may oppose any modernization plan as the officer corps could use a professional army in order to threaten the traditional theocratic institutions."
 himalaya_tibet.7.a:0 "This process will take time..."
 himalaya_tibet.9.t:0 "The Search for the Dalai Lama"
 himalaya_tibet.9.desc:0 "Just mere years ago, back in the winter of 1933, the previous Dalai Lama passed away. After each death, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated somewhere in the vast lands of Tibet. Therefore the search for the Dalai Lama is the most important task of the regency government in order to ensure the continuity of the theocratic system. The regent has just convened the Tsongdu to determine where to search for the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. In this process two elements were essential: signs and omens would give the government general information on where to look for. Then the visions of the Regent would give more precise information on the location of the next Dalai Lama. He explained that last year, while he was at lake Lhamolatso, he saw the letters "a", "ka" and "ma", a monastery with a three-tiered turquoise roof, a gilded pagoda-like top and a twisting trail leading east of this monastery to a bare hill opposite a small one story house with a blue roof. The pictures in his mind reminded him of a distant and far-away region of Tibet, Amdo. What reinforces this belief is the fact that the head of the previous Dalai Lama turned east after his death. In addition, on the east side of a wooden pillar located in the northeast side of the throneroom, a great star-shaped fungus appeared overnight. It also appears that on several different occasions the state oracles Nechung, Gadong, and Samye had flung ceremonial scarves toward the east while in trance. \n\nA part of the assembly is convinced that searching parties must be sent to Amdo, this could prove to be very dangerous however, both for the search parties as well as the Dalai Lama himself, if he is indeed found. Nonetheless, one thing is clear, the Dalai Lama must be found!"
 himalaya_tibet.9.a:0 "Send out the search parties as quick as possible."
 himalaya_tibet.9.b:0 "Contact the region's administrators, we must seek their approval first."

 himalaya_tibet.10.b:0 "We can't allow foreign agents in our territory."
 himalaya_tibet.11.t:0 "The Dalai Lama has been found!"
 himalaya_tibet.11.desc:0 "In the small and isolated village of Taktser, on a hill surrounded by few fields and a sea of steppic wilderness where nomadic herders wander. It was one of only 17 houses, a rectangular, ground-level building, with its various parts arranged around a wide central courtyard and a rectangular flat roof. There were no openings on the outside walls, except for the doorway. On the roof, there were three chimneys stacks and two air-holes. Around the roof were small gutters with spouts giving out into the courtyard. Over the entrance, there was a socket fixed in the roof to take a 10-foot-high flagpole. \n\nThe search party came there because of the letter "a" seen by the Reting Rinpoche in his vision was referring to the province of Amdo, the letter "ka" certainly meant the monastery of Kumbum. That building was three stories high and roofed by blue tiles, as described by the Regent. The last part of the vision indicated a house with a peculiar tree. Here, finally, they saw a house with a gnarling juniper bush on the flat roof...\n\nIn order to investigate, Kewtsang Rinpoche who was leading the party, disguised himself as a servant while they asked to stay for the night. In it live a couple of peasants and their children, the first one was living at the Kumbum monastery as he had been recognized as the reincarnation of the Taktser Rinpoche. One of those children suddenly recognized him and called him "Sera Lama" multiple times, as if he knew his monastery. A few days later they came back with some of the objects brought from Lhasa and he recognized those belonging to the previous Dalai Lama. The party then left for Kumbum, bringing with them the latest incarnation of Avalokiteśvara."
 himalaya_tibet.11.a:0 "They must return as soon as possible"
 himalaya_tibet.12.t:0 "The Tibetans seem to have found the child"
 himalaya_tibet.12.desc:0 "One of the Tibetan search parties may have found the Dalai Lama in the small village of Taktser. The child with brought to the monastery of Kumbum and it seem that they are preparing to depart to Lhasa."

 himalaya_tibet.18.desc:0 "The lavish procession has been traveling for days. Each morning after he had left the place where he slept, the local inhabitants dedicated the room as a chapel. The holy child travelled in a golden sedan chair accompanied by an enormous suite and lots of worshipers wishing to approach the living manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of compassion. Preparations for his enterence into the Holy City of Lhasa had to be moved along quite fast however. We can only be happy that the Dalai Lama is truly in safe hands now."

It's there that the Dalai Lama was formally enthroned and definitively recognized as the spiritual and temporal ruler of Tibet. Nevertheless, the child can't rule yet as he has still to become a monk and study religious texts for years before the regency could finally step down."
 himalaya_tibet.20.a:0 "Long live the Dalai Lama!"

 himalaya_tibet.23.t:0 "The True Dalai Lama has been Revealed"
 himalaya_tibet.23.desc:0 "After a vision of one of the most important oracle, it appears that the true Dalai Lama has not been chosen. Using the golden urn to select a new one it appears that the true Dalai Lama is Chao Kung, an abbot from China who claimed to have been the Dalai Lama for some time."
 himalaya_tibet.23.a:0 "All hail the True Dalai Lama!"

 himalaya_tibet.25.t:0 "Arrival of The German Expedition"
 himalaya_tibet.25.desc:0 "A foreign scientific expedition coming from a country close to the British Isles called Germany has arrived in Lhasa in order to study the Tibetan anthropological and ethnic characteristics. They have been eager to discuss with multiple aristocrats and have even been received at Norbulingka very soon. However, during discussions, it has been noted that these men are part of the German SS and maybe have some ties to the higher-ups in the military, it might be wise to utilize this while we can..."

In addition it will try to meet some ancient sages and try to study a mysterious force: the vril.

 himalaya_tibet.31.desc:0 "We have finally received the letter of resignation of Trimön. He may have been the leader of the Kashag at the time of the death of the 13th Dalai Lama and one of the few who accompanied the Regent on his pilgrimage to the lake of Lhamolatso in the summer of 1935, but Trimön has recently become only the shadow of his former self. He may have been arrogant before, but his recent behavior was has become closer to madness. One night, he was heard crying and shouting wildly while banging on the wooden door of the Jokhang Temple. That scandal, among other eccentricities lead to an increase pressure in order to obtain his resignation."
 himalaya_tibet.31.a:0 "He has served his country well!"

 himalaya_tibet.32.t:0 "We have been blackmailed!"
 himalaya_tibet.32.desc:0 "After that the probable candidate was found and escorted to the Monastery of Kumbum, the news spread in the region that the Dalai Lama was there. In that evening armed soldiers arrived at the monastery in order to ensure the security of the child. We now know what happened after the discovery of this very credible candidate but sadly the soldiers won't allow the expedition to go back as a merry procession. Instead they are demanding 100.000 coins of silver in order to free him. It's clear that we are victim of a cruel blackmail and that we have little choices but to agree to those outrageous demands."
 himalaya_tibet.32.a:0 "Let's hope that we will never hear of him again."

This comes as no surprise to the people of Tibet nor the aristrocrats leading it as Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen has already stated some time ago that he will indeed resign if Trimön Shappe is allowed to resign and isn't appointed Head Minister. It appears that this did in fact happen, so it is no surprise why the Regent has also decided to resign, however, this places the government in a terrible state of chaos and confusion.

Auch eine Abteilung zur Herstellung von Wollstoffen und Teppichen sowie das von Ringang errichtete Wasserkraftwerk von Dogde (Dog-sde) gehörten zu Trabshi Lekhung.

 #follow Neame's plan---> end try recruit him
 # The officer corps of this brigade was critical. About fifteen officers, including nine
 #commanders, should be trained in Waziristan on India's northwest frontier; since that terrain is
 #similar to that of Tibet, they could learn appropriate tactics there. Junior officers and
 #noncommissioned officers should receive training in Gyantse.

 #Although Gould strongly supported this plan, the Foreign and Political Department of the
 #Government of India was not at all enthusiastic about Gould's urging the Tibetan government
 #to approve Neame's recommendations. In a telegram to the secretary of state for India in
 #London, the department stated that Gould's recommendations for new weapons for Tibet had
 #not been authorized p 287

 #The legacy of the military-monastery conflict of the early 1920s still cast its shadow over Tibetan politics.
 #Tibetans made excellent troops when properly led and armed, but the political implications of a
 #modern and efficient army continued to threaten the religious elite and precluded the
 #development of such a force. The Tibetan government continued purposely to maintain an
 #ineffective army.

 #Le moine Kunphéla devient le rival du ministre laïc Tsarong et du secrétaire aux finances Lungshar. Tsarong, a qui le 13e Dalai Lama a confié la direction de l'armée en 1929, est démis de ses fonctions militaires en 1931 et remplacé par Kunphéla, désormais à la tête du Drabshi Lékhoung, le service rassemblant l'arsenal, la centrale hydro-électrique et l'Hôtel de la Monnaie. Au faîte de son ascension au pouvoir, Kunphéla crée, en 1932, le Drongdrag Maggar, un régiment d'apparat privé, fort de 1 000 hommes issus de la noblesse219.
