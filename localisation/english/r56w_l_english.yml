#Discover the Necrowombaticon
 r56w.event.30.t:0 "A Strange Book"
 r56w.event.30.d:0 "We have recently come into possession of some very unusual spoils, the most notable of which is an ancient book covered in arcane and bizarre symbology. Some of our scholars believe that it could be worth studying, while others suggest that it might be no more than a hoax."
 r56w.event.30.a:0 "Meddling with dark forces? Sign me up!"
 r56w.event.30.b:0 "No thanks."

#The Necrowombaticon can be studied
 r56w.event.31.t:0 "Our Scholars Report"
 r56w.event.31.d:0 "After a period of study, it has become clear that the book describes an elaborate ritual for gaining vast amounts of power. It calls for large quantities of scented candles, a black cat, and a great deal of enriched uranium.\n\n Along with the translation for the ritual comes a cryptic curse, \"Warning! Going forward with this will really mess with your game and result in something very silly. Save now, if in doubt.\" \n\nShould we move forward or abandon this path entirely?"
 r56w.event.31.a:0 "I eat danger for breakfast."
 r56w.event.31.b:0 "...but the historical!"

#The Necrowombaticon's deadly power is revealed
 r56w.event.32.t:0 "A Dimensional Distortion"
 r56w.event.32.d:0 "Our scholars performed the ritual precisely as instructed. Unfortunately, this resulted in a small-scale nuclear inferno that appears to have torn the fabric of space and time. An army of creatures has come pouring forth from the distortion, pushing our forces back. We have lost the Oregon territory and, along with it, some of our national dignity."
 r56w.event.32.a:0 "Well s***."

#News of the book's power reaches the world
 r56w.event.33.t:0 "Strange Happenings"
 r56w.event.33.d:0 "Reports of unusual activities have been reported from North America. The occupying forces have denied all unusual suggestions, but this has been somewhat undercut by their unexpected and fairly disorganized abandonment of the Oregon territory. Only time will tell the truth of the matter."
 r56w.event.33.a:0 "I wonder what that's all about?"

#How do we react to these events?
 r56w.event.34.t:0 "A Diplomatic Overture"
 r56w.event.34.d:0 "A representative of the monsters has arrived at our doorstep and politely requested to speak with you. Though their language is strange and cryptic, we were able to discern a single question:\n\n\"Can has?\""
 r56w.event.34.a:0 "This is all very silly. Say nothing!"
 r56w.event.34.b:0 "Can has... War!"
 r56w.event.34.c:0 "Yeah, sure. Whatever."

#The Tender Loving Empire is Defeated
 r56w.event.35.t:0 "The Impossible Victory"
 r56w.event.35.d:0 "The force of monsters that had come from nowhere into our world has been defeated. Though they tried to wreak havoc, their efforts were ultimately for naught. Today is a calmer and more sane day."
 r56w.event.35.a:0 "They were super OP anyway."

#To War or Not to War
 r56w.event.36.t:0 "War Games"
 r56w.event.36.d:0 "Our military leadership is playing a game to see what country we should attempt to conquer next. If we want, the results can be binding and put into immediate effect."
 r56w.event.36.a:0 "Seems legit."
 r56w.event.36.b:0 "Maybe later..."
 r56w.event.36.c:0 "Stop asking!"

#Invisibile DOW event

#Hitler's Stach
 r56w.event.38.t:0 "The Razor of Justice"
 r56w.event.38.d:0 "Our Ministers have proposed a bold plan to bring one of our enemies down a peg. It's time to strike at none other than Adolf Hitler and teach him the value of a good shave. \n\nOur agents are standing by. Shall we attempt the expedition?"
 r56w.event.38.a:0 "That sounds like a lovely idea!"
 r56w.event.38.b:0 "Not at the moment."
 r56w.event.38.c:0 "It is a silly suggestion."

#The World Learns of the Stache
 r56w.event.40.t:0 "Mustache Malfunction"
 r56w.event.40.d:0 "This morning the leader of the German Reich woke up to find an absolute atrocity had been committed to his facial hair. He was führious - and declared that all mustaches are now banned until he can regrow his own."
 r56w.event.40.a:0 "A national monument has been desecrated."

#Proposal for Taking Europe
 r56w.event.41.t:0 "A Simple Proposal"
 r56w.event.41.d:0 "A minister of ours has suggested an audacious plan for planting an agent in the European forces. What shall we do?"
 r56w.event.41.a:0 "Fund it!"
 r56w.event.41.b:0 "No thanks. I prefer pancakes."

#Agent Werewaffle Reports
 r56w.event.42.t:0 "Our Agent Reports"
 r56w.event.42.d:0 "Minster Thinking Waffle has reported and has already undergone the required changes to blend in with Belgian society. Now, as a part-werewolf-waffle, he can strike at night while being delicious during the day."

#News of the Belgian Takeover
 r56w.event.44.t:0 "Delicious Revolution"
 r56w.event.44.d:0 "The country of Belgium has had an unexpected change in leadership recently. A news conference was held by what appeared to be a sentient Waffle, which then turned into a wolf and mauled a nearby vice minister. Pundits are not sure what the new leader's international policy decisions will entail, but it will most certainly not involve syrup."
 r56w.event.44.a:0 "Breakfast will never be the same again."

#GE Adopts a Cat
 r56w.event.45.t:0 "A Good Deed"
 r56w.event.45.d:0 "Upon walking down a long lane in London, Greatexperiment spotted a stray kitten. It mewed softly and then asked for a cigar. I suppose it could be adopted?"
 r56w.event.45.a:0 "Yes! Bring the hijinx!"
 r56w.event.45.b:0 "Noooo! The unforeseen consequences!"

#The Cat Runs Away
 r56w.event.46.t:0 "Not Enough Catnip"
 r56w.event.46.d:0 "Sometime in the night, the cigar-smoking cat vanished from inside the President's palace. A strange note was found afterward suggesting the need for a bigger litter box."
 r56w.event.46.a:0 "I sense a plot twist."

#News of the Cat Takeover
 r56w.event.48.t:0 "The Rise of the fantastic furries"
 r56w.event.48.d:0 "Deep in the heart of the deserts of Saudi Arabia, a formidable and slightly annoyed army has arisen from nowhere. Having declared themselves and taken territory, they have promptly demanded tuna and to be petted when approval is given."
 r56w.event.48.a:0 "Impawsibble!"

#Daniel Craig Appears
 r56w.event.49.t:0 "Release the Craigken!"
 r56w.event.49.d:0 "A man has appeared, claiming to be a super-spy from the distant future. Having given no details or reasoning, he claims that it is vital for the timeline that he be allowed to take over Tibet. The fate of the world depends on it."
 r56w.event.49.a:0 "Yeah, sure. Whatever."
 r56w.event.49.b:0 "Turn him into glue."

 r56w.event.51.t:0 "Something Fluffy This Way Comes"
 r56w.event.51.d:0 "Greatexperiment recently decided to go on a holiday to Britain. While on a stroll, he came across a rather strange and suspicious puppet hiding behind a phone booth. \n\n\"I really should infuse this thing with magic so that it will take over the country and cause absolute havoc.\", Greatexperiment said to himself."
 r56w.event.51.a:0 "Yeah, why not?"
 r56w.event.51.b:0 "Nah. Throw it in the river."

#Hitler and Baldur's Gate
 r56w.event.100.t:0 "A Curious Door"
 r56w.event.100.desc:0 "Today at the Reich Chancellery, Baldur von Schirach suggested to the Führer his own design for the construction of Germania.\n\nAlways ready to discuss cultural matters, he designed in secret a new type of door that is causing some division among Hitler's inner circle. The motives are judged to be unworthy of the capital of Europe by Albert Speer. At the same time, the rumor circulates that Himmler admires the Nordic mythological references and judges it "authentically German".\n\nToday, the Reich Chancellery did not perform any critical work as the Nazi leadership was too busy discussing Baldur's Gate."
 r56w.event.100.a:0 "Send the plans to Arno Breker."

#Comet Tank sighted

r56w.event.101.desc:0 "While it was driving too close from the limit of the Bovington military base, an experimental variant of our new Comet tank was inadvertently sighted by a few civilians passing by. We must act quickly to ensure that the matter will be dealt with with the necessary discretion. The MPs are understandably irritated, and the tank driver will undoubtedly be reprimanded.\n\nIf loose lips sink ships, they can also pierce armor."
r56w.event.101.a:0 "Let's make a few phone calls."
