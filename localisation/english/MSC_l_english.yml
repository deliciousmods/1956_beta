 newsmod.3.d:0 "This past year, ultra-nationalist fascist movements exploded in Britain. The democratic way of life has become a minority as the nation embraces fascism. What's more - the British have decided to join in an alliance with Hitler and the German Reich, threatening the stability of Europe. The Dominions have also been forced to join the Axis, but they are reluctant and feel the time has come to distance themselves from Britain...."

Members of the Italian Communist Party orchestrated a bloody assassination not just for the Duce but many prominent leaders of the fascist regime. Reports say the Duce was warned against holding the parade in Milan, as northern Italy has a huge amount of communist sympathizers. When suggested to move the annual parade to Naples instead, the Duce refused. With Mussolini dead, the state of Italian politics has once again turned chaotic as armed communists seize positions in government and call for a full overthrowing of the fascist regime."
