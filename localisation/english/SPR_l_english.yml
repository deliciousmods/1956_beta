 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Spanish Republic is only five years old but has seen itself confronted with instability from both sides of the political spectrum. The failure of the Asturian uprising in 1934 left many marks on Spanish society, and the corruption of Alejandro Lerroux's government only made the population lose more trust in it, leading to a radicalisation of the population.\n\nOn the left is the Popular Front, united in their anti-fascism and their desire for a reform of the republic, while on the right, the CEDA is getting closer and closer to authoritarianism and corporatism and the Falange is becoming more and more threatening."

The right is becoming more radical by the day. The CEDA grows discontent with the democratic system, and the Falangists continue to gain in popularity. Whispers of a military conspiracy have made the left paranoid enough that worker unions have begun to form into makeshift militas. This has lead to confrontations between political opponents that often culminate in violence.\n\nSpain is beyond the point of no return, a Civil War is all but certain."
