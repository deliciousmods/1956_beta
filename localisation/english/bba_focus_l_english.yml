 ITA_carica_di_isbuscenskij_desc:0 "Some say that the days of the horse and the rider on the battlefield are over. That the role of cavalry has been taken over by tanks and airplanes. But they are wrong - a horse does not need fuel, it does not need a groundcrew, it requires no spare parts except a new horseshoe every now and then. This gives cavalry a clear advantage even on the modern battlefield."

 ITA_italian_tankettes:1 "Italian Tankettes"
 ITA_italian_tankettes_desc:1 "While other countries might develop ever larger and ever heavier tanks in search of the super-tank that will render all other tanks obsolete, we know that the best tank is a tank that is actually on the field. A tank must be fast enough to go wherever it is needed in time, and it really only needs armor heavy enough to withstand rifles. Such a vehicle would be cheap and quick to produce."
 ITA_bersaglieri:0 "Bersaglieri"
 ITA_bersaglieri_desc:0 "The Bersaglieri, our elite light infantry, have long distinguished themselves in battle. While the future of warfare may be mechanized, the quality of the individual soldier will still be the decisive factor."
 ITA_divisioni_alpine:0 "Divisioni Alpine"
 ITA_divisioni_alpine_desc:0 "Our memory of the Great War will forever include the brutal fighting in the high alps. If we ever have to defend our country against a foreign invasion again, it will certainly come from the north, and require more fighting in inhospitable mountains. We must have soldiers capable of fighting effectively in that terrain."
 ITA_fanti_dell_aria:0 "Fanti dell'Aria"
 ITA_fanti_dell_aria_desc:0 "The bloody stalemate of the Isonzo Front during the Great War forced us into frontal assaults against a well-prepared enemy. The only way to accomplish a breakthrough was by crossing no-mans-land and taking the enemy trench. Modern planes can carry a group of soldiers quickly, far into the enemy's rear areas. Landing by parachute they can take strategic objectives to destabilize the enemy front-line."
 ITA_self_propelled_guns:0 "Self-Propelled Guns"
 ITA_self_propelled_guns_desc:0 "The tank may have revolutionized warfare, but in many ways the self-propelled gun the is the most valuable vehicle on the battlefield.

 ITA_end_fiat_ansaldo_duopoly:0 "End Fiat-Ansaldo Duopoly"
 ITA_end_fiat_ansaldo_duopoly_desc:0 "Our mechanical and motorized engineering sector has long been dominated by two companies: Fiat and Ansaldo. While these two companies are absolutely world-class engineering firms, it has somewhat stiffled growth as no competitors can survive in the market. We will have to break this duopoly if we want to have a healthy engineering sector in the long term."
 ITA_modernize_ansaldo_facilities:0 "Modernize Ansaldo Facilities"
 ITA_modernize_ansaldo_facilities_desc:0 "The economic downturn following the Great War plunged Ansaldo into such financial difficulties that they have largely been unable to properly modernize their factories. Only their elevated status has saved them from bankruptcy.

 ITA_expand_rome_flying_school:0 "Expand Rome Flying School"
 ITA_expand_rome_flying_school_desc:0 "With the growing complexity of modern planes comes an increased risk of accidents if pilots are insufficiently trained.

 ITA_reggianes_exports:0 "Reggiane's Exports"
 ITA_reggianes_exports_desc:0 "The Reggiane company has developed a series of quite capable fighter planes that have caught the attention of foreign militaries seeking to modernize their airforce.

 ITA_diving_bombers:0 "Diving Bombers"
 ITA_diving_bombers_desc:0 "The topic of Close Air Support has gained considerable importance in military circles. While planes have long been used to drop bombs, it appears that several countries have started to develop specialized planes that can place a bomb with unmatched accuracy by diving from high altitude. While our industry could no doubt produce such a plane in time, there are other countries that have designs for this very purpose."
 ITA_superaereo:0 "Superaereo"
 ITA_superaereo_desc:0 "The days of small groups of planes flying here and there are long gone. A modern air campaign is in many ways similar in complexity to any land-based undertaking.

 ITA_officers_of_the_service_role:0 "Officers of the Service Role"
 ITA_officers_of_the_service_role_desc:0 "It is no longer sufficient to simply take officers from the army and teach them how to fly. Our airforce requires a new breed of officer, one that was raised and molded by the service instead of merely adopting it."
 ITA_standardization:0 "Standardization"
 ITA_standardization_desc:0 "The war in the air, more so than the war at sea and the war on land, is a war of industry against industry. Mass and mass alone is decisive.

 ITA_specialization:0 "Specialization"
 ITA_specialization_desc:0 "Try as we might, we will never be able to match the bigger powers in terms of raw output. The only way we can compete in the air is by building better planes than anyone else. Each of them will have to be able to win a fight even when outnumbered three or four to one."

 ITA_expand_naval_facilities:0 "Expand Naval Facilities"

 ITA_naval_air_coordination:0 "Naval-Air Coordination"
 ITA_naval_air_coordination_desc:0 "Up until now the air force high command has followed its own doctrine and not coordinated well with the navy.

 ITA_incrociatori_leggeri:0 "Incrociatori Leggeri"
 ITA_incrociatori_leggeri_desc:0 "Fast and powerful enough to take on other light cruisers and sweep destroyers before them, but cheap enough to build in numbers, light cruisers are important in protecting our sea lanes, and in taking the fight to enemy convoys.

 ITA_incrociatori_pesanti:0 "Incrociatori Pesanti"
 ITA_incrociatori_pesanti_desc:0 "For now, Italy lacks the industrial base to build enough battleships for them to be everywhere we need them at once.
