[CHI.GetLeader] and [ENG.GetLeader] have reached an agreement that [USA.GetLeader] could not stand. However, [ENG.GetLeader] seems to be quite disgusted towards the fact that [CHI.GetName] could gain some political benefit from the terms.\n\nSome experts say that this conference would mean that [ENG.GetName]'s relationship with [USA.GetName] would deteriorate rather quickly in the following years and might even cause blocs within the democratic world."

If we do not act now, [Root.GetLeader] may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.10.d_nl:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. [Root.GetLeader] is disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetRulingParty].\n\n[Root.GetLeader] remain certain that the people will eventually pick up their sense of pride, but is hesitating on what course of action to take. Some of the supporters call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
