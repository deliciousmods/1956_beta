ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the dusk settled on the Russian, Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires following the Great War, Romania, who had fought on the side of the Entente, was now the undisputed hegemon of the Balkans.\nHowever, not all is well in the nation. The country's frail democracy has been in an power struggle with King Carol ever since the beginning of his reign, with Codreanu's Iron Guard waiting for their opportunity to strike.\nNow, with a resurgent Germany looking to expand it's influence in the Balkans, and a new Communist threat to the east eyeing it's former territories, Romania must pick its friends carefully, lest an old enemy come knocking."

rt56.romania.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Proposes Trade Agreement"
rt56.romania.1.d:0 "In a meeting in Berlin today the Romanian government proposed a trade agreement between our nations. This could prove to be especially lucrative as the Romanian oil fields in Muntenia should be of high value for us in our coming plans."
rt56.romania.1.a:0 "It's a good day to be a friend of the [FROM.GetAdjective]s"
rt56.romania.1.b:0 "We need not trade with them to get their oil."
rt56.romania.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] agrees to the trade proposal"
rt56.romania.2.d:0 "A telegram just arrived in Bucharest, stating that the [FROM.GetAdjective]s have agreed to the trade proposal."
rt56.romania.2.a:0 "Terrific!"
rt56.romania.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] declines the trade offer."
rt56.romania.3.d:0 "After a somber journey back home, we were informed that the [FROM.GetAdjective]s will not be taking up the proposed trade agreement."
rt56.romania.3.a:0 "Very unfortunate."
rt56.romania.4.t:0 "The German Four Year Plan"
rt56.romania.4.d:0 "Early today a man by the name of Helmuth Wolthat arrived in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] with yet another proposal from [GER.GetNameDef]. Just like how the previous trade agreement we signed with Germany is probably angled in their favour, this one is as well, though even more egregiously so. The proposed Four Year plan would see most of, if not all, oil production in Muntenia go directly to [GER.GetNameDef] while we see small industrial gains that are far beyond the actual value of the oil.\n\nWhile not explicitly stated, there is undoubtedly a veiled threat behind his words."
rt56.romania.4.a:0 "And submit to ecomnomic domination?! Never!"
rt56.romania.4.b:0 "We best not anger the Eagle..."
rt56.romania.4.c:0 "Let's propose a counter offer..."
rt56.romania.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] yields rights to oil"
rt56.romania.5.d:0 "Returning to [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] today, Herr Helmuth Wolthat was pleased to announce that [FROM.GetNameDef] agreed to further economic cooperation, thus ensuring that the oil fields of Muntenia will be ready to fuel our coming war effort."
rt56.romania.5.a:0 "What a pleasant surprise"
rt56.romania.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap]s counter offer"
rt56.romania.6.d:0 "While it is not what we initially expected to gain out of the proposed Four Year plan where [FROM.GetNameDef] would allow us full access to their oil, they have countered with an offer to help build up our synthethic industry so that we may produce more oil natively. While it's not going to be close to the same amount of oil, it would be a stop gap until we can get the Romanian oil fields into our sphere more permanently."
rt56.romania.6.a:0 "Sounds reasonable enough"
rt56.romania.6.b:0 "They'll come running to us soon enough anyway..."
rt56.romania.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] accepts our offer"
rt56.romania.7.d:0 "Good news come from Berlin today as the Germans have announced that they will be accepting the counter proposal we have proposed. This will allow us to further improve our economy while still retaining economical independence from Germany."
rt56.romania.7.a:0 "That's a relief"
rt56.romania.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] declines the counter proposal"
rt56.romania.8.d:0 "While the Germans will not be putting us in a state of economical domination, they have announced that the counter proposal we suggested wasn't good enough and there will be no assistance from them when it comes to improving the Romanian economy."
rt56.romania.8.a:0 "We should be vary"
rt56.balkan_pact.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] wants to strengthen the Balkan Pact"
rt56.balkan_pact.1.d:0 "Since the signing of the Balkan Pact in 1934, the members of the Balkan Pact have stood guard against potential future Bulgarian aggression, however with the Italians and Germans succumbing to Fascism, it is time that we strengthened the Balkan Pact and ensure that we are ready if Bulgaria tries to cast the Balkans into chaos."
rt56.balkan_pact.1.a:0 "The Balkan Pact must stand"
rt56.balkan_pact.1.b:0 "And risk another powderkeg?"
rt56.balkan_pact.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] agrees to renew the pact"
rt56.balkan_pact.2.d:0 "Today our envoy that we sent to [FROM.GetNameDef] returned with pleasant news that the [FROM.GetAdjective]s will be renewing their obligations to the Balkan Pact."
rt56.balkan_pact.2.a:0 "Terrific!"
rt56.balkan_pact.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] betrays the Pact"
rt56.balkan_pact.3.d:0 "As our envoys returned from [FROM.GetNameDef] they brought grim tidings, the [FROM.GetAdjective]s will not be renewing their signatory status as a member of the Balkan Pact..."
rt56.balkan_pact.3.a:0 "Warmongers..."
rt56.balkan_pact.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] invites us to the Balkan Pact"
rt56.balkan_pact.4.d:0 "Despite the Balkan Pact being a defensive pact against us, [FROM.GetNameDef] has in a meeting today extended an invitation for us to join in on the Balkan Pact. The invitation means policies of non-aggression with the current members of the pact, but also us renouncing our territorial claims."
rt56.balkan_pact.4.a:0 "Cooperation will benefit us all in the long run"
rt56.balkan_pact.4.b:0 "This is just a ruse"
rt56.balkan_pact.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] joins the Balkan Pact"
rt56.balkan_pact.5.d:0 "Today marks the first day that all of the Balkans can look forward without worry about their neighbours, instead, a new era of cooperation between our nations can begin."
rt56.balkan_pact.5.a:0 "The Balkans united"
rt56.balkan_pact.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] refuses to sign the pact"
rt56.balkan_pact.6.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, [FROM.GetNameDef] has declined our invitation to join in on the Balkan Pact, wether it is because they wish to push their territorial claims, we are uncertain. But one thing we know for sure is that they can not be trusted."
rt56.balkan_pact.6.a:0 "To be expected..."
rt56.balkan_pact.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] proposes formalization of the Balkan Entente"
rt56.balkan_pact.7.d:0 "In a meeting today between all the members of the Balkan Pact, [FROM.GetLeader] proposed a formalization of the Balkan Pact, turning it into a proper alliance against any outward facing threats that might threaten the stability of the Balkans. With the obvious defensive benefits of forming the faction, there are potential drawbacks with it as well..."
rt56.balkan_pact.7.a:0 "For a prosperous Balkan region!"
rt56.balkan_pact.7.b:0 "And risk external intervention?"
rt56.balkan_pact.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] joins the Balkan Entente"
rt56.balkan_pact.8.d:0 "Seeing more benefits than maluses in the suggestion the [FROM.GetAdjective]s have agreed to the proposal and have joined our faction."
rt56.balkan_pact.8.a:0 "For the future"
rt56.balkan_pact.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] declines the invitation"
rt56.balkan_pact.9.d:0 "Arguing that creating yet another political bloc inside Europe could risk destabilizing the region, as well as not wanting to tie themselves down to a faction, the [FROM.GetAdjective]s have backed out of the talks."
rt56.balkan_pact.9.a:0 "Most unfortunate..."
rt56.balkan_pact.20.t:0 "Balkan Pact Under Attack"
rt56.balkan_pact.20.d:0 "It has come to our attention that our allies in [FROM.GetNameDefCap] have been attacked or invaded by [BUL.GetAdjective] forces just some days ago! Due to our agreements with the [FROM.GetAdjective] government, we are expected to join the war and aid our [FROM.GetAdjective] allies. However, that might not be in our best intentions, we must decide quickly, time is running out."
rt56.balkan_pact.20.a:0 "We beat them once, we'll beat them again!"
rt56.balkan_pact.20.b:0 "We cannot afford to wage yet another war with the [BUL.GetAdjective]s..."
rt56.rom_west.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] requests Military Guarantees"
rt56.rom_west.1.d:0 "With War looming on the horizon, we have for a few months attempted to formalize an alliance with [FROM.GetNameDef], however our wishes have seemingly fallen on deaf ears. But today that seems to have changed, in a meeting today between [FROM.GetLeader] and [THIs.GetLeader], the former expressed that he required a military guarantee before he'd consider entering into an alliance with us."
rt56.rom_west.1.a:0 "Very well, [FROM.GetNameDef] shall have their guarantee"
rt56.rom_west.1.b:0 "And risk destabilizing the region?"
rt56.rom_west.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] guarantees military support"
rt56.rom_west.2.d:0 "Good news have come back from [THIS.GetLeader]'s meeting with [FROM.GetLeader], [FROM.GetNameDef] has promised to provide military support should we find ourselves in a defensive war."
rt56.rom_west.2.a:0 "Splendid!"
rt56.rom_west.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] denies the request"
rt56.rom_west.3.d:0 "Although returning with many good news, [THIS.GetLeader] was saddened to say that they were unable to secure military support from [FROM.GetNameDef], meaning we can not count on them in case of invasion."
rt56.rom_west.3.a:0 "We don't need them..."
rt56.rom_stab_ger.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] is preparing for peace..."
rt56.rom_stab_ger.1.d:0 "Our agents in Stockholm have brought back information that a regime change might take place in our ally [FROM.GetNameDef] and that the new regime is looking to sign an armastice with [SOV.GetNameDef]. We should keep our eyes open for a potential betrayal."

rt56.rom_stab_ger.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] sues for Peace"
rt56.rom_stab_ger.2.d:0 "Early today our foreign minister met with his [FROM.GetAdjective] counterpart in Stockholm. The [FROM.GetAdjective] laid forward that a regime change is likely to take place and that they wished to sue for peace with [ROOT.GetNameDef] and are willing to accept the terms that had been brought forth as demands a few months earlier if we provide aid in driving the [GER.GetAdjective]s out of their lands."
rt56.rom_stab_ger.2.a:0 "It'll help strangle the [GER.GetAdjective]. We will accept."

rt56.rom_stab_ger.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] signs the Armistice"
rt56.rom_stab_ger.3.d:0 "With the Armistice signed, we now find ourselves at peace with [FROM.GetNameDef] and we can now turn our attention to the [HUN.GetAdjective]s and retake Transylvania!"

rt56.rom_stab_ger.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] declines the peace offer."
rt56.rom_stab_ger.4.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has told us that there will be no peace until all of [ROOT.GetName] is broguht to heel before the might of the Red Army. We now have to make our final stand, for Romania."

rt56.rom_general_election.1.t:0 "The General Election"
rt56.rom_general_election.1.d:0 "With the General Election taking place it's time to see how the future of Romania will take shape. The National Liberal Party have been a front runner for quite some time and is looking to come out pretty strong, however their rivals, the National Peasants' Party are looking equally strong.\n\n\nHowever as with all things politics, you never know exactly what might happen when the polls are counted."
rt56.rom_general_election.1.a:0 "As we expected, the King will have to step in"

rt56.rom_general_election.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] requests aid in upcoming crisis"
rt56.rom_general_election.2.d:0 "Following the electoral deadlock and rumors of a potential revolution brewing among the leftist elements, the Romanian Government has reached out to us as members of the Balkan Pact with a request for us to provide them with materialistic aid, asking for any guns and heavy artillery pieces that we can spare should the Communist elements cast the nation into a civil war.\n\nThe situation that is brewing in Romania has the potential to spill over into our lands as well if it's not stopped. Should we try and aid them now and risk facing a stronger Communist State if they fall, or should we keep our equipment and be more prepared to stand against the Communists if they win?"
rt56.rom_general_election.2.a:0 "Absolutely!"
rt56.rom_general_election.2.b:0 "We can not spare anything..."
rt56.rom_general_election.21.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] will supply arms"

rt56.rom_general_election.32.a:0 "Bastards..."
rt56.rom_general_election.4.t:0 "Deadlock in the Election"
rt56.rom_general_election.4.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events it seems that after having counted not twice, but three times, that there isn't a single party or faction that seems capable of forming its own governemnt. With essentially a electoral deadlock being in place and no parties being willing to work with one another to form a government has cast a shadow of doubt upon the current regime.\n\nWhile various political parties look for someone to gather around, rumors of a leftist revolution are starting to circulate..."
rt56.rom_general_election.4.a:0 "We must tread carefully..."
rt56.rom_general_election.5.t:0 "The Romanian Civil War"
rt56.rom_general_election.5.d:0 "It's been just over six months since the deadlock struck and Romania found itself at a tipping point. Now, two prominent sides have formed and the future has never been more uncertain than at this moment.\n\nWill the Revolutionaries cast down the old Regime, or will the rag-tag coalition prevail? Only time will tell, but for now, there is only one thing left to do..."
rt56.rom_general_election.5.a:0 "To Arms!"
rt56.rom_general_election.6.t:0 "Romanian Stalemate"
rt56.rom_general_election.6.d:0 "After having fought along the revolutionaries in Romania against the old Regime, we have come to a point where the cost lives and materiel outshine the value of adding another revolution to our side. Our forces have already begun to extract from the country as we sign a ceasefire."
rt56.rom_general_election.6.a:0 "That is... infuriating"
rt56.rom_general_election.7.t:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective]s Intervene"
rt56.rom_general_election.7.d:0 "Siting the unwillingness to just sit and watch as fellow revolutionaries rise up against their oppressors, [FROM.GetNameDef] has announced that it will be engaging in a peacekeeping mission, whose goal it is to stabilize Romania and return stability to the region."
rt56.rom_general_election.7.a:0 "The Red Army approaches..."
rt56.rom_general_election.8.t:0 "The Emergency Election"
rt56.rom_general_election.8.d:0 "Though the decision to force the Election to take place earlier than normal may have been unpopular, it was vital that we did so for the integrity of Democracy within our nation. Now, we just have to wait and see where Democracy will lead us."
