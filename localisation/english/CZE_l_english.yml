The established company had a key influence on forming the structure of the Bohemian chemicals industry during the Industrial Revolution and in the 20th century and on the development of the city itself.\n\nEventually, the Association for Chemical and Metallurgical Production became the most significant competitor of Germany's IG Farben-Industrie AG in Central Europe and the Balkans and the fourth largest chemical concern in Europe. The company from Aussig accounted for more than 60% of Czech chemical production.\n\nBefore the occupation of the Sudetenland in 1938, IG Farben exercised significant technical influence on the Czech chemical industry, and several cartels were established between both companies, including plans for synthetic oil factories.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Germany (through newly established Sudetenländische Treibstoffwerke AG) finished the construction works on refineries in Most (Brux), and synthetic oil production from brown coal started in 1942.

In this era, the company's most notable products were the Panzer 38(t) tanks and Jagdpanzer 38(t) tank destroyers."

Zbrojovka Brno and Škoda, were the crucial exporters. The production and export activities of the arms companies were coordinated and non-competitive and often had the form of a cartel.\n\nTanks from CKD (mainly customized variants of TNH series) were exported worldwide, which continued even during World War II but was limited only to Axis satellite countries. When Germany occupied the country, it mainly used the extensive armaments production industry to fuel its war machine.\n\nHowever, they did not limit the export to arms deliveries but also sales of license rights to produce advanced Czechoslovak weapons. The famous British Bren gun was based on a licensed version of Czechoslovak ZGB-33 (modified version of ZB vz. 26) light machine gun. The same weapon was also licensed to Japan and known as Type 97. The BESA machine gun was the British version of the Czechoslovak ZB-53 (TK vz. 37) heavy machine gun.\n\nIt is a little ironic that many armies used weapons from a country that the French and British sacrificed in the name of 'peace for our time' to kill soldiers on both sides of the Second World War conflict.\n\nThe Czechoslovak government played a crucial role in procuring new arms deals or license production agreements."

The first deliberate mining of radioactive ores took place in Jachymov (then called Joachimsthal), a silver-mining city in then Austria-Hungary. Marie Curie used pitchblende ore from Jachymov to isolate radium, a decay product of uranium.\n\nUntil the Second World War, uranium mining was done primarily for the radium content. Sources of radium contained in the uranium ore were sought for use as luminous paint for watch dials and other instruments, as well as for health-related applications, some of which, in retrospect, was undoubtedly harmful. The byproduct uranium was used mainly as a yellow pigment.\n\nwestern part of the country was in the center of attention of world powers shortly after the war - the landscape around the town of Jachymov was the place of world exclusivity - uranium mining. It was the only place where the Soviet Union could immediately obtain uranium ore and begin the development of nuclear weapons, especially after the United States toppled the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Thus Czechoslovakia became the prime source of uranium for the Soviet Union after World War II.\n\nAfter the Communist party took control of Czechoslovakia in 1948, large prison camps were established in the town and around it. Opponents of the new regime were forced to mine uranium ore under very harsh conditions and the average life expectancy in Jáchymov at this period was 42 years. Eventually, the uranium mining operation ceased in 1964."

It was established on January 3, 1920, and its mission consisted of preparing officers (lieutenants) for all branches of the Czechoslovak army. By 1938 thousands of officers, including many future generals, graduated from the academy.\n\nThe middle level of education was represented by schools for reserve officers (Školy Důstojníků v Záloze (ŠDZ) that were organized as part of divisional headquarters and provided training and education for officers at the lower command positions.\n\nMilitary specialists were trained in dedicated military schools, including infantry, artillery, aviation, cavalry, engineering, telegraphs, arms, and since 1933 also the School of Armoured Troops (Škola Útočné Vozby).

Czechoslovakia was among the six most prominent exporters of weapons in the world long before the Second World War.\n\nFor a long time, the Czechoslovak industry could easily cover both domestic needs of the army as well as export a considerable amount of war material. However, when the Ministry of National Defense increased the demand for supplies of weapons and ammunition, the major Czechoslovak companies lacked the needed production capacity. It had to be expanded by building new factories.\n\nČeská Zbrojovka established a new branch in small Moravian town Uhersky Brod in 1936, and the new factory was built within 16 weeks of the initial decision. ČZUB manufactured a wide variety of small arms, including some famous post-war weapons.\n\nIn 1936 Sellier & Bellot moved the whole production to Vlašim, where a new complex was under construction since 1934. When a new order from the Ministry of Defense came in 1938, it was decided to build a new S & B factory in Porúbka in Slovakia. However, the project was halted by the signing of the Munich Agreement.\n\nThe escalation of the Sino-Japanese conflict was a jackpot for Czechoslovak companies, especially Česká Zbrojovka. According to British records, more than half of the machine guns which passed through Hong Kong in the latter part of 1938 and were destined for China were of Czechoslovak origin (approximately one-third in the case of infantry rifles).\n\nFurthermore, In 1937 Sellier & Bellot received orders for 200 million cartridges of 7.92 mm Mauser from China; however, the contract had not been completed before the outbreak of the war."

At that time, the company's management moved from Vienna to Prague after a call from the Czechoslovak state authorities. In 1919 the TATRA brand appeared on vehicles for the first time.\n\nThe company was incorporated into the Ringhoffer Corporation in 1926. In 1936, after another approximation with the Prague magnate, Ringhoffer TATRA, a.s. was founded and renamed to Ringhoffer TATRA Werke AG two years later.\n\nExcept for some contracts for armored cars, the company never really succeeded in any military contests. The CKD/Skoda cartel almost always secured the contracts for the Czechoslovak army, often thanks to bribes. However, this did not stop Tatra from developing its armored vehicles and even experimental tanks apart from the traditional car, truck, and locomotive production.\n\nDuring World War II, Tatra was instrumental in producing trucks and tank engines for the German war effort, and the famous T 111 was born. This three-axle heavy truck with a directly air-cooled twelve-cylinder diesel engine remained in production for 16 years.\n\nAnother successful design, the Tatra 87 car, was supposedly popular amongst German officers during World War II for its superior speed and handling on the Autobahn. The Tatras influenced both Hitler and Porsche. Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast and had ridden in Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia.\n\nMany German officers met their deaths driving heavy, rear-engined Tatras faster around corners than they could handle. At the time, as an anecdote, Tatra became known as the 'Czech Secret Weapon' for the scores of officers who died behind the wheel - at one point, official orders were issued forbidding German officers from driving."

The new air force was helped significantly by a French donation of 127 aircraft.\n\nThe Czechoslovak leadership needed to build a capable air force for a modern nation surrounded by potentially hostile neighbors without access to the ocean. So was born the motto "Air is our sea". The Czechoslovak government, between the wars, balanced a home-grown aviation industry with licensing engines and aircraft designs from allied nations. Several major aircraft companies, and a few engine companies, thrived in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s, including Avia, Aero, and state-controlled Letov.\n\nAlthough Germany took Czechoslovakia without a fight, many Czechoslovak pilots did excellent work during the war. They started leaving the country in 1939 to oppose Germany abroad. They went to Poland, Yugoslavia, and France. After the war began, they were at all fronts, in all kinds of uniforms and airplanes, helping to stop the attacker.\n\nThey saw their first significant victory in the Battle of Britain as part of five Czechoslovak RAF squadrons, Numbers 68, 310, 311, 312, and 313.\n\nFollowing an agreement between the Czechoslovak government in London and the Soviet Union, some Czech pilots went to the Eastern front. They formed the first Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment, the first Czechoslovak exile soldiers to enter the liberated Czechoslovak soil.\n\nIn the meantime, the Czechs at the western front kept fighting the Luftwaffe. They patrolled the Atlantic, destroyed the V1 missiles, and took part in the invasion of Normandy.\n\nThere is no exaggeration in saying that while nobody knew about Czech pilots in 1918, they were among the best in the world in 1945."

However, later some new licenses for modern airplanes were purchased from France and the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1934, the Ministry of National Defence decided that the air forces would be equipped with a single type of fighter, the Avia B.534 biplane, which eventually became the backbone of the Czechoslovak Air Force with 568 planes, built in four series (versions).\n\nWhen in the spring of 1935, Germany publicly confessed to building a strong Air Force, Czechoslovakia and France responded by deepening aviation cooperation. Czechoslovak High Command reacted to this new fact by expanding three airfields to seven, each capable of supplying two bomber squadrons that would arrive from France in case of war with Germany.\n\nEarly in 1936, a new batch of Avia B.534 aircraft was ordered by MND, with planes entering service in the spring of 1937. The last version of the plane included various refinements that allowed the IV. series to have an increased speed of over 200 mph (320 km/h), which placed it on par with the best of its contemporary biplanes.\n\nGeneral Jaroslav Fajfr was the head of the III.

These men traveled around the world before reaching their newly independent homeland.\n\nAfter their return to Czechoslovakia, many formed the core of the new Czechoslovak Army.

His main 'weakness' was his German wife, something his opponents used against him and made him an unacceptable choice for a Chief of Staff.\n\nDuring the Munich crisis, Prchala was the commander of the IV.

He contacted the 2nd Department in 1932 mainly because he needed money for his profligate way of life and offered cooperation on paper.\n\nHe was a high-ranking member of the German military intelligence organization, the Abwehr. He was also a highly decorated Nazi party member with good connections originating from his post as a foundation member of SA.\n\nHe provided a vast array of important information about the German intelligence services to Czech agents, who, in turn, forwarded the data to SIS London. Thümmel also delivered details over "military capabilities, and intentions" as well as "detailed information on the organization and structure of the Abwehr and SD along with "the near-complete order of battle of the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, and German mobilization plans". Later, he also supposedly gave advanced warnings of the German annexation of the Sudetenland and the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland.\n\nIn October 1941, the Gestapo accused SS Paul Thümmel of tipping off Yugoslavian officials about Germany's April 1941 attack on their country. They also suspected him of collaborating with Czech resistance leader Captain Vaclav Moravek. Thümmel regularly supplied the Abwehr with classified SS information. Therefore, the chief of Abwehr, Admiral Canaris, stepped forward to defend him as an Abwehr double-agent.\n\nHistorians still debate whenever Agent A-54 was really some double agent 'ace', or just an elaborate ploy by Abwehr to feed misinformation to the Czechoslovak Intelligence and allies. Nevertheless, Thümmel was eventually caught, charged with treason, and later killed by the SS at Theresienstadt concentration camp in April 1945."

When the war was over, Pellé was experiencing a period of great popularity among the Czechoslovak public.\n\nUnder the General's command, the Czechoslovak army proved its combat readiness and regained its honor. Pellé intended to use this in his favor when promoting his concept of a permanent Czechoslovak army as part of the Allied army. He intended to reflect this in the new Czechoslovak National Defense Act, which he essentially achieved in 1920. The first Czechoslovak military academy was inaugurated in 1920 to train high-ranking domestic officers.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, General Pellé led the French mission in Czechoslovakia from 1919 until 1920. As a soldier and diplomat, he fully understood his unique position in Czechoslovakia: an intermediary between Czechoslovakia and France. Several times, Pellé backed Czechoslovakia, risking the disapproval of his French superior. He also had personal reasons for this because he met his future wife in Prague, whom he married in 1921.\n\nGeneral Eugène Mittelhausser replaced Pellé in 1921 and served as the head of the military mission until 1926, when he was replaced by Louis Eugene Faucher that held the position until 1938.\n\nIn Paris, the Treaty of Alliance and Friendship between France and Czechoslovakia was signed on January 25, 1924."

Nevertheless, during the 1930s, the three states increasingly adopted independent foreign policies, mainly after Germany occupied the Rhineland in 1936 and the French support, upon which the entente relied, lost much of its value.\n\nHistorically, the entente lost its remaining political significance when in April 1937, both Yugoslavia and Romania denied a request by Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, that the entente pledges total military aid to a member that was the victim of aggression.

They tried hard to persuade the Allies that Czechoslovakia should have its historic crownland borders.\n\nWhile the negotiations over Ruthenia and Upper Hungary were successful, the Czech delegation had to withdraw in many cases, for example, in Kladsko, Lusatia, or a corridor to Yugoslavia.\n\nLusatia had a specific role in that political play for territorial claims. A relatively strong Lusatian national movement existed, demanding autonomy within Germany or incorporation to the new Czechoslovak republic. The question of Lusatia was not of vital importance for Czechoslovak diplomats. Without transparent support of the Czechoslovak state, the unofficial Lusatian delegation at the Peace Conference could not put the Lusatian demands through the Conference´s agenda. Nevertheless, good relations between the Czechs and the Sorbs continued during the First Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nHistorically, the Lusatia region became part of Prussia at the Vienna Congress in 1815.

Thus conscription and mobilization plans had to be adjusted accordingly to avoid possible desertion in case of conflict with Germany.\n\nAfter finishing their military service, the conscripts were transferred to active reserves, divided into I. and II. reserves.\n\nThe I. reserve consisted of fit and healthy conscripts of up to 40 years old. They were to be mobilized in the case of war and were also used to reinforce the army as required.\n\nThe II. reserve was for those conscripts who were not eligible for the I. reserve. Those who were beyond the age of 40 and those who were not fit enough for active service. They were to fulfill support roles or serve in the rear echelon. Conscripts drafted over the standard yearly quota or those that full-service would materially harm were part of so-called Replacement reserves but technically included in II. reserves.\n\nMembers of I. reserves were obliged to perform several military exercises: two that lasted four weeks and three that lasted three weeks. Members of replacement reserves had to complete an additional four weeks of training.\n\nThe Ministry of National Defense had additional authority to call the I. and Replacement reserves for additional special, up to four weeks long exercises.

Sokols made trips in national costumes (Kroj), were present at national ceremonies and public exercises, and generally encouraged people to show patriotism.\n\nThe biggest event organized by Sokol is the "všesokolský slet" (meeting of all Sokol members) that takes place once every six years. These meetings originated in June 1882, and the first "slet" counted more than 700 sportspeople.\n\nSokol flourished during the interwar period, and during this time, the membership grew to over a million. Influential politicians, including the first two presidents of the Czechoslovak Republic, Masaryk and Beneš, were members of Sokol.\n\nIn this period, nationalism increased, and ethnic discrimination or even anti-semitism was nothing exceptional. Sokol members also actively participated in the "Czechization" of ethnic Germans in the border regions and German language islands and generally shared the responsibility with other Czech and German associations for the resulting national hatred between Czechs and Germans in the interwar period.\n\nSokol was almost liquidated three times and was banned by all totalitarian regimes in Czechoslovak history. Firstly, Sokol was banned in 1915 during World War I. Secondly, it happened during the Nazi occupation of Czech lands. Finally, Sokol was banned by the communists after 1948. In 1968, struggles for Sokol revival were killed by normalization, and so after 42 years of hibernation, Sokol was restored for the fourth time in 1990."

In October 1922, the Czech Red unions held a congress, formalizing the split with the Social Democratic unions.\n\nThe Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was a massive organization in this period, claiming 170,000 members in 1922, dwarfing all but a few Communist parties around the world.\n\nDuring the Great Depression in the first half of the 1930s, the Red Unions organized a series of strikes and demonstrations while collaborating with members of other trade unions.\n\nOne of the most significant union strikes in central Europe was organized by the Red Unions in Most, Czechoslovakia, in March 1932. What started as a small strike of laid-off miners from the mines "Nelson" and "Humboldt II" quickly escalated to a general strike of the whole mining region along with a demonstration of over 40,000 people.

However, the anti-German focus of the law further escalated the ethnic conflict. It was one of the reasons why the United Kingdom refused to support Czechoslovakia during the Sudetenland crisis and effectively sided with Hitler (Lord Runciman Mission).\n\nOne of the (many) controversies of the law was the definition of so-called "state unreliable persons". Such a person had several restrictions; for example, they were not allowed to run a business of strategic importance or receive important public contracts but could also be laid off from employment without any justification.\n\nFurthermore, the authorities were not obliged to give any reasons for their decision in this matter, and thus it was permissible to issue such a decision without any justification. Judicial review of "unreliable person status" was not possible. All this made the law highly abusable.\n\nThe act also permitted the government in a national emergency to impose tight controls on all industrial enterprises that it deemed essential to its security.\n\nAlthough one cannot deny the legitimacy of the effort to ensure Czechoslovakia can adequately defend itself from external threats, the law stepped far beyond what is permissible in a democratic constitutional state.\n\nQuite ironically, the State Defense act proved an effective instrument for the Wehrmacht after the 1939 occupation. It allowed for the quick seizure of the armaments industry of the newly established Protectorate.\n\nOne German armament expert supposedly called it "one of the best laws on war economy in Central Europe" and "an exemplar of tight organization concentrated in one hand" to effectively control all branches necessary for arms production.\n\nThe Minister of National Defense, František Machník, was amongst the greatest proponents of the State Defense Act."

Most argued that the Sudetenland, with its overwhelming ethnic German majority and exceedingly distinct culture and economic potential, should manage its political affairs autonomously.\n\nConsistently, the Czechoslovak government refused any notion of autonomy for the Sudeten Germans due to the crippling effect of giving almost a third of the country autonomy and control over one of the most important industrial centers. The Sudeten-Germans responded by increasing political radicalization.\n\nThe concomitant ascension of the pan-Germanic Adolf Hitler in Germany in 1933, with his rhetoric of uniting all Germans across Europe against the perfidy and 'oppression' of the Slavs, greatly gravitated the Sudeten-Germans towards racialist and far-right nationalism. The vast majority of Sudeten-Germans quickly called for almost complete autonomy or even independence from Czechoslovakia and possible merger into the Third Reich. The leading vanguard of the pan-Germanist movement was the Sudeten German Party (SdP) of Konrad Henlein.\n\nThe peaceful coexistence between Czechs and Germans in Czechoslovakia was always a matter of a relatively small part of the German and Czech population under the leadership of individual politicians. In the tense period of early 1938, waves of extreme nationalism on both sides aggravated the situation.\n\nIt should be noted that the concessions made by the Czechoslovak government in late 1938 would be most likely enough for the Sudeten-Germans would they have been implemented before 1938.\n\nUnfortunately, the reforms and autonomy laws drafts came at a point of no return and could not change anything.

Amid international tensions, Czechoslovakia established the new service in 1937.\n\nState Defense Guard (in Czech Straz obrany statu, SOS) was a military service created in October 1936 to protect the borders of Czechoslovakia. The newly established defense guard had three main tasks: protecting the border, keeping order and the rule of law, and supporting executions of customs duty.\n\nMembers of the guard were local policemen, existing finance guards, and members of state police. Later, citizens loyal to Czechoslovakia were incorporated (for example, many members of sports organization Sokol or active anti-fascist Germans). The government created plans to support the guard with regular army units to handle local conflicts.\n\nThe planned size of the service was 38 battalions, but only 31 had been mustered (one of them in Prague). Their equipment were pistols, rifles, light machine guns, and grenades.\n\nAs the tensions between Czechoslovakia, local Germans, and Nazi Germany grew, the guard was deployed on the border during May 1938 and stayed there until September, when the Allies ceded Sudetenland to Germany. During September, the guard fought low-level warfare with local German partisans (Sudetendeutsches Freikorps) and commandos from Germany. After the loss of borderland, SOS moved inland on new positions.

In some Czech sources, the conflict is described as the 'Seven-day war' because of its quick conclusion.\n\nThe chief importance of Cieszyn Silesia was the rich coal basin around Karviná and the valuable Košice-Bohumín Railway line, which linked the Czech lands with Slovakia. Furthermore, in north-western Cieszyn Silesia, the railroad junction of Bohumín served as a crossroad for international transport and communications.\n\nThe casus belli for the war was the Polish preparation of national parliamentary elections in the area designated Polish in the interim agreement as no sovereign rule was to be executed in the disputed areas.\n\nThe Polish government declined Prague's request that the Poles cease their preparations, and the Czechoslovak side decided to stop the preparations by force. Because most Polish troops were engaged in fighting with the West Ukrainian National Republic over eastern Galicia, Czechoslovak forces quickly gained the upper hand. However, Czechoslovakia was forced to stop the advance by the Entente, and Czechoslovakia and Poland were compelled to sign a new demarcation line. The disputed territory was placed under international control.\n\nThe final division of Cieszyn Silesia came in July 1920 due to the Spa Conference. In conclusion, the railway line connecting the Czech lands with Slovakia and the territory to the south were assigned to Czechoslovakia, while the territory north of the railway line was transferred to Poland. After that, the region under the control of Czechoslovakia was known as Zaolzie, a name that means 'lands beyond the Olza river'.\n\nPoland briefly occupied the region during the Munich Crisis, and it was later annexed by the independent Slovak state but returned under Czechoslovak control after World War II.

    czke.418.d:0 "The National Fascist Community (Národní obec fašistická) was a Czechoslovakian Fascist movement led by Radola Gajda and based on the Fascism of Benito Mussolini. The party was formed in March 1926 by the merger of a group of dissident National Democrats known as the "Red-Whites" with various other rightist groups across Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nIt was distinguished by a strong current of opposition to Germany, which continued even after Adolf Hitler had come to power. Instead, the NOF looked to Italy as its model and based itself wholly on Mussolini's National Fascist Party. In this respect, it differed markedly from its chief rival 'Vlajka', which was firmly in the Hitler camp.\n\nGroups targeted by the NOF for criticism included the Jews, communists, the Czechoslovak government, and the Magyars. It set up a youth group and a small trade union movement.\n\nThe group also advocated a policy of Pan-Slavism and hoped to take a joint lead with Poland of a grand Slavic alliance that would overthrow communism in the Soviet Union. They also believed in a corporatist economy with a large agricultural sector. The NOF attracted some early support from veterans of the Czechoslovak Legions.\n\nThe party failed to maintain its support and received only 2% of the vote and seven seats in the National Council in the elections of 1935. It was eventually disbanded during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nDuring most of NOF's existence, it was led by the former general and hero of the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia, Radola Gajda. In 1933 Gajda was briefly imprisoned and stripped of military rank and pension due to the so-called 'Zidenice Mutiny' scandal, a failed military coup done by certain fascist elements in the military.\n\nGajda was marginalized during the 1939-1945 occupation and abandoned politics. He occasionally assisted the Czech resistance by helping army officers flee into Poland and hiding his son's resistance activities. He was investigated by the Gestapo but avoided imprisonment.\n\nWhen World War II ended, Gajda was imprisoned by the NKVD and interrogated under harsh conditions. In April 1947, he was brought to trial for 'propagation of Fascism and Nazism', for which the prosecutor requested a life sentence. Gajda's guilt was far from clear, and the resulting sentence of two years allowed him to leave prison shortly after that. Penniless and forgotten, he died several months later."

The British mediators were active in Czechoslovakia during the late summer, issuing their report shortly before the Munich Conference in September.\n\nThe report of the Runciman Mission, in the form of letters to the British and Czechoslovak prime ministers dated [GetDateText], was intensely hostile in tone towards the Czechoslovak Government and recommended the immediate transfer of the mainly German-inhabited territories to Germany. The 2000-word report firmly blamed the breakdown in negotiations on the SdP leadership, who used the pretext of civil unrest in some German areas to sever contacts. The report also noted that Beneš's 'Fourth Plan' proposals met "almost all the requirements" of the SdP's demands. Nevertheless, when itemizing the grievances of the German minority, Runciman expressed his sympathy for the Sudeten case observing that it was "a hard thing to be ruled by an alien race". Although declaring that Czech rule was "not actively oppressive, and certainly not 'terroristic'", the report alleged, "it was marked by tactlessness, lack of understanding, petty intolerance and discrimination".\n\nHowever, should the Czechoslovak government solve the Sudetenland problem before the escalation of the ethnic conflict, the report of the Runciman Mission would probably turn favorably for the Czech side.

When the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC) was finally established in the latter year, this outcome represented a compromise between the extreme, doctrinaire policies of the Comintern and the more moderate Czechoslovak-oriented views of Bohumil Smeral, the party's first leader.\n\nKSC organization was based on the Leninist concept of democratic centralism, which provided for the election of party leaders at all levels but required that each level be fully subject to the control of the next higher unit. Accordingly, party programs and policies were directed from the top, and resolutions of higher organs were unconditionally binding on all lower organs and individual party members. In theory, policy matters were freely and openly discussed at congresses, conferences, membership meetings, and party press. In practice, however, these discussions merely reflected decisions made by a small contingent of top party officials.\n\nIn 1929 Klement Gottwald became the party's Secretary-General after the purging from it of various oppositional elements, some of whom allied themselves to Lev Trotsky and the International Left Opposition.\n\nIn 1935 parliamentary election party held its original 30 mandates with little over 10% votes. However, the events of 1938 resulted in the party being banned, but it continued to exist as an underground organization.\n\nDuring World War II, many KSC leaders sought refuge in the Soviet Union, where they prepared to broaden the party's power base once the war ended.

The militias were hastily equipped and set on alert during the communist takeover of power at the end of February.

About 3,000 militiamen joined police forces. Non-communists were slowly removed from the militias. The control over the militias went to the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nIn February 1948, the militias obtained 10,000 rifles and 2,000 submachine guns from the armament factory Zbrojovka Brno.

Like Hawker Hurricane, the plane featured retractable undercarriage and a standard armament of one 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub and two 7.92 mm machine guns in the wings. Avia engineers planned to replace the insufficient Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine with a stronger one, but the war prevented any modernization of the plane.\n\nAnother interesting and promising design was the Praga E-51, developed by ČKD Praga. It was a reconnaissance, heavy fighter that could also act as a light bomber, similar in design to the Fw 189 or the P-38 Lightning. The only known prototype flew first in May 1938, too late to be refined and mass-produced for the Czechoslovak Air Force. Later, it was confiscated and tested in Rechlin, Germany, and never seen again."

    czke.224.d:0 "By [GetDateText], it was clear to the Czechoslovak High Command that the biplane fleet of the Czechoslovak Air Force would need modern monoplanes, should it ever come to war with Germany. Thus a new modernization program was initiated, and the government set strict requirements and specifications for both fighters and bombers.\n\nOne of the most promising bomber prototypes, Aero A.300, represented a modern bomber propelled by powerful Bristol Mercury IX radial engines. It was faster than any other Czechoslovak airplane, except the Avia B-35 prototype. The Germans captured the plane in 1939, and it was examined and tested by Focke-Wulf engineers in Bremen, never to be seen again.\n\nAvia introduced a new light bomber aircraft, an advanced derivate of the previous B-58 prototype. The B.158 was a three-seat low-winged monoplane with inverted gull-wings, a retractable tailwheel undercarriage, and 634 kW (850 hp) Avia (Hispano-Suiza) 12Ydrs engines, which made its maiden flight in mid-1938.\n\nLetov also provided a new design, Š-50. Designed to be a general-purpose monoplane, it was powered by two 420 hp (313 kW) Avia Rk.17 radial engines and equipped with three machine guns and up to 600 kg of bombs. It could be fitted with a radio station and cameras for reconnaissance duty."
