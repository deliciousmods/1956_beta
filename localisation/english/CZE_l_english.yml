The Czech industrial potential, inherited from the Habsburg period, outsized the domestic market of the First Republic, making the country exceedingly dependent on export. The Great Depression had the most devastating effect on consumer goods industries concentrated in German-majority regions. The agricultural sector too wasn't spared — with the British starting to export sugar from Cuba, Czechoslovak exports plummeted, wreaking havoc on local producers. \n\nSudetenland was industrially the most advanced part of the Czech Lands, primarily specialised in export-oriented industries, and was, as a consequence, the region that suffered most during the crisis. This further alienated the Germans from the Czechs because they believed that the Czechoslovak state and the Czech banks weren't doing enough to help them. \n\nAt the same time, the Slovak industries were being outcompeted by the more effective Czech industries, which benefited from the laissez-faire attitude of the central government. This aggravated the deterioration of relations between Czechs and Slovaks. The final devaluation of 1936 increased the competitiveness of Czechoslovakia's export products, allowing it to begin the economic recovery, though it did little to help the poor and unemployed within the country." #+#

After the tragic death of Tomaš Baťa in 1932, his half-brother, Jan Antonin Baťa, took control of the company and, in the following years, gained the nickname "The King of the Shoes".\n\nWhen Baťa died in 1932, the company employed 16,560 people and maintained 1,645 shops and 25 enterprises. Following the plans laid down by his brother before his death, Jan Antonin Baťa expanded the company to more than six times its original size throughout Czechoslovakia and the world. Tomas Baťa's company policy was to establish villages around the factories for the workers, complete with schools and welfare. These villages include, for example, Batadorp in the Netherlands, Batovany and Svit in Slovakia, Batov in the Czech Republic, Borovo-Bata (now Borovo Naselje) in Croatia, Bata Park in Switzerland (Möhlin), Bataville in France (Lorraine), Batawa in Canada, East Tilbury in England, Batapur in Pakistan, and Batanagar and Bataganj in India.

The established company had a key influence on forming the structure of the Bohemian chemical industry during the Industrial Revolution and in the 20th century, as well as on the development of the city itself.\n\nEventually, the Association for Chemical and Metallurgical Production became the most significant competitor of Germany's IG Farben-Industrie AG in Central Europe and the Balkans and the fourth largest chemical concern in Europe. The company from Aussig accounted for more than 60% of Czech chemical production.\n\nBefore the occupation of the Sudetenland in 1938, IG Farben exercised significant technical influence on the Czech chemical industry, and several cartels were established between both companies, including plans for synthetic oil factories.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Germany (through the newly established Sudetenländische Treibstoffwerke AG) finished the construction works on refineries in Most (Brux), and synthetic oil production from brown coal started in 1942.

ČKD quickly expanded its production of locomotives and tanks. \n\nEmil Kolben, a Czech engineer and entrepreneur, was the founder and director of ČKD until the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia when he was recalled and imprisoned in the concentration camp Theresienstadt, where he died in 1943. \n\nDuring the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II, the company was renamed BMM (Böhmisch-Mährische Maschinenfabrik AG) and manufactured arms for the Wehrmacht. In this era, the company's most notable products were the Panzer 38(t) tanks and Jagdpanzer 38(t) tank destroyers." #+#

Zbrojovka Brno and Škoda, were the crucial exporters. The production and export activities of the arms companies were coordinated and non-competitive and often had the form of a cartel.\n\nTanks from CKD (mainly customized variants of TNH series) were exported worldwide, which continued even during World War II but was limited only to Axis satellite countries. When Germany occupied the country, it mainly used the extensive armaments production industry to fuel its war machine.\n\nHowever, they did not limit the export to arms deliveries but also sales of license rights to produce advanced Czechoslovak weapons. The famous British Bren gun was based on a licensed version of Czechoslovak ZGB-33 (modified version of ZB vz. 26) light machine gun. The same weapon was also licensed to Japan and known as Type 97. The BESA machine gun was the British version of the Czechoslovak ZB-53 (TK vz. 37) heavy machine gun.\n\nIt is a little ironic that many armies used weapons from a country that the French and British sacrificed in the name of 'peace for our time' to kill soldiers on both sides of the Second World War conflict.\n\nThe Czechoslovak government played a crucial role in procuring new arms deals or license production agreements."

For use as illuminating paint for watch dials and other equipment, as well as for health-related purposes, some of which were probably hazardous in retrospect, sources of radium found in the uranium ore were sought. Uranium, a byproduct, was mostly employed as a yellow pigment.\n\nThe western region of the nation caught the interest of major global powers soon after the war, and the area near the town of Jachymov became the exclusive location of uranium mining.

It was established on January 3, 1920, and its mission consisted of preparing officers (lieutenants) for all branches of the Czechoslovak army. By 1938 thousands of officers, including many future generals, graduated from the academy.\n\nThe middle level of education was represented by schools for reserve officers (Školy Důstojníků v Záloze (ŠDZ) that were organized as part of divisional headquarters and provided training and education for officers at the lower command positions.\n\nMilitary specialists were trained in dedicated military schools, including infantry, artillery, aviation, cavalry, engineering, telegraphs, arms, and since 1933 also the School of Armoured Troops (Škola Útočné Vozby).

By 1936, 34,557 weapons were available for the army, and several thousand were ordered for fortifications.\n\nThe TK vz. 37 heavy machine gun was a refinement of the previously used vz. 35.

Czechoslovakia was among the six most prominent exporters of weapons in the world long before the Second World War.\n\nFor a long time, the Czechoslovak industry could easily cover both the domestic needs of the army as well as export a considerable amount of war material. However, when the Ministry of National Defense increased the demand for supplies of weapons and ammunition, the major Czechoslovak companies lacked the needed production capacity. It had to be expanded by building new factories.\n\nIn 1936, Česká Zbrojovka established a new branch in the small Moravian town of Uhersky Brod, and the new factory was built within 16 weeks of the initial decision. ČZUB manufactured a wide variety of small arms, including some famous post-war weapons.\n\nIn 1936 Sellier & Bellot moved the whole production to Vlašim, where a new complex had been under construction since 1934. When a new order from the Ministry of Defense came in 1938, it was decided to build a new S & B factory in Porbka, Slovakia. However, the project was halted by the signing of the Munich Agreement.\n\nThe escalation of the Sino-Japanese conflict benefited Czechoslovak companies, especially Česká Zbrojovka. According to British records, more than half of the machine guns that passed through Hong Kong in the latter part of 1938 and were destined for China were of Czechoslovak origin (approximately one-third in the case of infantry rifles).\n\nFurthermore, in 1937, Sellier & Bellot received orders for 200 million cartridges of 7.92 mm Mauser from China; however, the contract had not been completed before the outbreak of the war." #+#

At that time, the company's management moved from Vienna to Prague after a call from the Czechoslovak state authorities.

In 1936, after another approximation with the Prague magnate, Ringhoffer TATRA, a.s. was founded and renamed Ringhoffer TATRA Werke AG two years later.\n\nExcept for some contracts for armoured cars, the company never really succeeded in any military contests. The ČKD/Škoda cartel almost always secured the contracts for the Czechoslovak army, often thanks to bribes. However, this did not stop Tatra from developing its armoured vehicles and even experimental tanks apart from traditional car, truck, and locomotive production.\n\nDuring World War II, Tatra was instrumental in producing trucks and tank engines for the German war effort, and the famous T 111 was born. This three-axle heavy truck with a directly air-cooled 12-cylinder diesel engine remained in production for 16 years.\n\nAnother successful design, the Tatra 87 car, was popular amongst German officers during World War II for its superior speed and handling on the Autobahn. Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast and had ridden in the Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia.\n\nMany German officers met their deaths driving heavy, rear-engined Tatras faster around corners than they could handle.

The new air force was helped significantly by a French donation of 127 aircraft.\n\nThe Czechoslovak leadership needed to build a capable air force for a modern nation surrounded by potentially hostile neighbors without access to the ocean. So was born the motto "Air is our sea". The Czechoslovak government, between the wars, balanced a home-grown aviation industry with licensing engines and aircraft designs from allied nations. Several major aircraft companies, and a few engine companies, thrived in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s, including Avia, Aero, and state-controlled Letov.\n\nAlthough Germany took Czechoslovakia without a fight, many Czechoslovak pilots did excellent work during the war. They started leaving the country in 1939 to oppose Germany abroad. They went to Poland, Yugoslavia, and France. After the war began, they were at all fronts, in all kinds of uniforms and airplanes, helping to stop the attacker.\n\nThey saw their first significant victory in the Battle of Britain as part of five Czechoslovak RAF squadrons, Numbers 68, 310, 311, 312, and 313.\n\nFollowing an agreement between the Czechoslovak government in London and the Soviet Union, some Czech pilots went to the Eastern front. They formed the first Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment, the first Czechoslovak exile soldiers to enter the liberated Czechoslovak soil.\n\nIn the meantime, the Czechs at the western front kept fighting the Luftwaffe. They patrolled the Atlantic, destroyed the V1 missiles, and took part in the invasion of Normandy.\n\nThere is no exaggeration in saying that while nobody knew about Czech pilots in 1918, they were among the best in the world in 1945."

However, later some new licenses for modern airplanes were purchased from France and the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1934, the Ministry of National Defence decided that the air forces would be equipped with a single type of fighter, the Avia B.534 biplane, which eventually became the backbone of the Czechoslovak Air Force with 568 planes, built in four series (versions).\n\nWhen in the spring of 1935, Germany publicly confessed to building a strong Air Force, Czechoslovakia and France responded by deepening aviation cooperation. Czechoslovak High Command reacted to this new fact by expanding three airfields to seven, each capable of supplying two bomber squadrons that would arrive from France in case of war with Germany.\n\nEarly in 1936, a new batch of Avia B.534 aircraft was ordered by MND, with planes entering service in the spring of 1937. The last version of the plane included various refinements that allowed the IV. series to have an increased speed of over 200 mph (320 km/h), which placed it on par with the best of its contemporary biplanes.\n\nGeneral Jaroslav Fajfr was the head of the III.

He was also a highly decorated Nazi party member with good connections originating from his post as a foundation member of SA.\n\nHe provided a vast array of important information about the German intelligence services to Czech agents, who, in turn, forwarded the data to SIS London. Thümmel also delivered details over "military capabilities, and intentions" as well as "detailed information on the organization and structure of the Abwehr and SD along with "the near-complete order of battle of the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, and German mobilization plans". Later, he also supposedly gave advanced warnings of the German annexation of the Sudetenland and the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland.\n\nIn October 1941, the Gestapo accused SS Paul Thümmel of tipping off Yugoslavian officials about Germany's April 1941 attack on their country. They also suspected him of collaborating with Czech resistance leader Captain Vaclav Moravek. Thümmel regularly supplied the Abwehr with classified SS information. Therefore, the chief of Abwehr, Admiral Canaris, stepped forward to defend him as an Abwehr double-agent.\n\nHistorians still debate whenever Agent A-54 was really some double agent 'ace', or just an elaborate ploy by Abwehr to feed misinformation to the Czechoslovak Intelligence and allies. Nevertheless, Thümmel was eventually caught, charged with treason, and later killed by the SS at Theresienstadt concentration camp in April 1945."

When the war was over, Pellé was experiencing a period of great popularity among the Czechoslovak public.\n\nUnder the General's command, the Czechoslovak army proved its combat readiness and regained its honor. Pellé intended to use this in his favor when promoting his concept of a permanent Czechoslovak army as part of the Allied army. He intended to reflect this in the new Czechoslovak National Defense Act, which he essentially achieved in 1920. The first Czechoslovak military academy was inaugurated in 1920 to train high-ranking domestic officers.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, General Pellé led the French mission in Czechoslovakia from 1919 until 1920. As a soldier and diplomat, he fully understood his unique position in Czechoslovakia: an intermediary between Czechoslovakia and France. Several times, Pellé backed Czechoslovakia, risking the disapproval of his French superior. He also had personal reasons for this because he met his future wife in Prague, whom he married in 1921.\n\nGeneral Eugène Mittelhausser replaced Pellé in 1921 and served as the head of the military mission until 1926, when he was replaced by Louis Eugene Faucher that held the position until 1938.\n\nIn Paris, the Treaty of Alliance and Friendship between France and Czechoslovakia was signed on January 25, 1924."

Nevertheless, during the 1930s, the three states increasingly adopted independent foreign policies, mainly after Germany occupied the Rhineland in 1936 and the French support, upon which the entente relied, lost much of its value.\n\nHistorically, the entente lost its remaining political significance when in April 1937, both Yugoslavia and Romania denied a request by Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, that the entente pledges total military aid to a member that was the victim of aggression.

They tried hard to persuade the Allies that Czechoslovakia should have its historic crownland borders.\n\nWhile the negotiations over Ruthenia and Upper Hungary were successful, the Czech delegation had to withdraw in many cases, for example, in Kladsko, Lusatia, or a corridor to Yugoslavia.\n\nLusatia had a specific role in that political play for territorial claims. A relatively strong Lusatian national movement existed, demanding autonomy within Germany or incorporation to the new Czechoslovak republic. The question of Lusatia was not of vital importance for Czechoslovak diplomats. Without transparent support of the Czechoslovak state, the unofficial Lusatian delegation at the Peace Conference could not put the Lusatian demands through the Conference´s agenda. Nevertheless, good relations between the Czechs and the Sorbs continued during the First Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nHistorically, the Lusatia region became part of Prussia at the Vienna Congress in 1815.

Those who were beyond the age of 40 and those who were not fit enough for active service They were to fulfil support roles or serve in the rear echelons. Conscripts who were drafted in excess of the standard yearly quota or whose full-service would be materially detrimental were classified as replacement reserves but technically included in the II Reserve. \n\nMembers of the I Reserve were obliged to perform several military exercises: two that lasted four weeks and three that lasted three weeks. Members of the replacement reserves had to complete an additional four weeks of training.\n\nThe Ministry of National Defense had the additional authority to call the I. and Replacement Reserves for additional special, up to four-week-long exercises.

Sokols made trips in national costumes (Kroj), were present at national ceremonies and public exercises, and generally encouraged people to show patriotism.\n\nThe biggest event organized by Sokol is the "všesokolský slet" (meeting of all Sokol members) that takes place once every six years. These meetings originated in June 1882, and the first "slet" counted more than 700 sportspeople.\n\nSokol flourished during the interwar period, and during this time, the membership grew to over a million. Influential politicians, including the first two presidents of the Czechoslovak Republic, Masaryk and Beneš, were members of Sokol.\n\nIn this period, nationalism increased, and ethnic discrimination or even anti-semitism was nothing exceptional. Sokol members also actively participated in the "Czechization" of ethnic Germans in the border regions and German language islands and generally shared the responsibility with other Czech and German associations for the resulting national hatred between Czechs and Germans in the interwar period.\n\nSokol was almost liquidated three times and was banned by all totalitarian regimes in Czechoslovak history. Firstly, Sokol was banned in 1915 during World War I. Secondly, it happened during the Nazi occupation of Czech lands. Finally, Sokol was banned by the communists after 1948. In 1968, struggles for Sokol revival were killed by normalization, and so after 42 years of hibernation, Sokol was restored for the fourth time in 1990."

What started as a small strike of laid-off miners from the mines "Nelson" and "Humboldt II" quickly escalated to a general strike of the whole mining region along with a demonstration of over 40,000 people.

However, the anti-German focus of the law further escalated the ethnic conflict. It was one of the reasons why the United Kingdom refused to support Czechoslovakia during the Sudetenland crisis and effectively sided with Hitler (Lord Runciman Mission).\n\nOne of the (many) controversies of the law was the definition of so-called "state unreliable persons". Such a person had several restrictions; for example, they were not allowed to run a business of strategic importance or receive important public contracts but could also be laid off from employment without any justification.\n\nFurthermore, the authorities were not obliged to give any reasons for their decision in this matter, and thus it was permissible to issue such a decision without any justification. Judicial review of "unreliable person status" was not possible. All this made the law highly abusable.\n\nThe act also permitted the government in a national emergency to impose tight controls on all industrial enterprises that it deemed essential to its security.\n\nAlthough one cannot deny the legitimacy of the effort to ensure Czechoslovakia can adequately defend itself from external threats, the law stepped far beyond what is permissible in a democratic constitutional state.\n\nQuite ironically, the State Defense act proved an effective instrument for the Wehrmacht after the 1939 occupation. It allowed for the quick seizure of the armaments industry of the newly established Protectorate.\n\nOne German armament expert supposedly called it "one of the best laws on war economy in Central Europe" and "an exemplar of tight organization concentrated in one hand" to effectively control all branches necessary for arms production.\n\nThe Minister of National Defense, František Machník, was amongst the greatest proponents of the State Defense Act."

Most argued that the Sudetenland, with its overwhelming ethnic German majority and exceedingly distinct culture and economic potential, should manage its political affairs autonomously.\n\nConsistently, the Czechoslovak government refused any notion of autonomy for the Sudeten Germans due to the crippling effect of giving almost a third of the country autonomy and control over one of the most important industrial centers. The Sudeten-Germans responded by increasing political radicalization.\n\nThe concomitant ascension of the pan-Germanic Adolf Hitler in Germany in 1933, with his rhetoric of uniting all Germans across Europe against the perfidy and 'oppression' of the Slavs, greatly gravitated the Sudeten-Germans towards racialist and far-right nationalism. The vast majority of Sudeten-Germans quickly called for almost complete autonomy or even independence from Czechoslovakia and possible merger into the Third Reich. The leading vanguard of the pan-Germanist movement was the Sudeten German Party (SdP) of Konrad Henlein.\n\nThe peaceful coexistence between Czechs and Germans in Czechoslovakia was always a matter of a relatively small part of the German and Czech population under the leadership of individual politicians. In the tense period of early 1938, waves of extreme nationalism on both sides aggravated the situation.\n\nIt should be noted that the concessions made by the Czechoslovak government in late 1938 would be most likely enough for the Sudeten-Germans would they have been implemented before 1938.\n\nUnfortunately, the reforms and autonomy laws drafts came at a point of no return and could not change anything.

Amid international tensions, Czechoslovakia established the new service in 1937.\n\nState Defense Guard (in Czech Straz obrany statu, SOS) was a military service created in October 1936 to protect the borders of Czechoslovakia. The newly established defense guard had three main tasks: protecting the border, keeping order and the rule of law, and supporting executions of customs duty.\n\nMembers of the guard were local policemen, existing finance guards, and members of state police. Later, citizens loyal to Czechoslovakia were incorporated (for example, many members of sports organization Sokol or active anti-fascist Germans). The government created plans to support the guard with regular army units to handle local conflicts.\n\nThe planned size of the service was 38 battalions, but only 31 had been mustered (one of them in Prague). Their equipment were pistols, rifles, light machine guns, and grenades.\n\nAs the tensions between Czechoslovakia, local Germans, and Nazi Germany grew, the guard was deployed on the border during May 1938 and stayed there until September, when the Allies ceded Sudetenland to Germany. During September, the guard fought low-level warfare with local German partisans (Sudetendeutsches Freikorps) and commandos from Germany. After the loss of borderland, SOS moved inland on new positions.

In some Czech sources, the conflict is described as the 'Seven-day war' because of its quick conclusion.\n\nThe chief importance of Cieszyn Silesia was the rich coal basin around Karviná and the valuable Košice-Bohumín Railway line, which linked the Czech lands with Slovakia. Furthermore, in north-western Cieszyn Silesia, the railroad junction of Bohumín served as a crossroad for international transport and communications.\n\nThe casus belli for the war was the Polish preparation of national parliamentary elections in the area designated Polish in the interim agreement as no sovereign rule was to be executed in the disputed areas.\n\nThe Polish government declined Prague's request that the Poles cease their preparations, and the Czechoslovak side decided to stop the preparations by force. Because most Polish troops were engaged in fighting with the West Ukrainian National Republic over eastern Galicia, Czechoslovak forces quickly gained the upper hand. However, Czechoslovakia was forced to stop the advance by the Entente, and Czechoslovakia and Poland were compelled to sign a new demarcation line. The disputed territory was placed under international control.\n\nThe final division of Cieszyn Silesia came in July 1920 due to the Spa Conference. In conclusion, the railway line connecting the Czech lands with Slovakia and the territory to the south were assigned to Czechoslovakia, while the territory north of the railway line was transferred to Poland. After that, the region under the control of Czechoslovakia was known as Zaolzie, a name that means 'lands beyond the Olza river'.\n\nPoland briefly occupied the region during the Munich Crisis, and it was later annexed by the independent Slovak state but returned under Czechoslovak control after World War II.

    czke.418.d:0 "The National Fascist Community (Národní obec fašistická) was a Czechoslovakian Fascist movement led by Radola Gajda and based on the Fascism of Benito Mussolini. The party was formed in March 1926 by the merger of a group of dissident National Democrats known as the "Red-Whites" with various other rightist groups across Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nIt was distinguished by a strong current of opposition to Germany, which continued even after Adolf Hitler had come to power. Instead, the NOF looked to Italy as its model and based itself wholly on Mussolini's National Fascist Party. In this respect, it differed markedly from its chief rival 'Vlajka', which was firmly in the Hitler camp.\n\nGroups targeted by the NOF for criticism included the Jews, communists, the Czechoslovak government, and the Magyars. It set up a youth group and a small trade union movement.\n\nThe group also advocated a policy of Pan-Slavism and hoped to take a joint lead with Poland of a grand Slavic alliance that would overthrow communism in the Soviet Union. They also believed in a corporatist economy with a large agricultural sector. The NOF attracted some early support from veterans of the Czechoslovak Legions.\n\nThe party failed to maintain its support and received only 2% of the vote and seven seats in the National Council in the elections of 1935. It was eventually disbanded during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nDuring most of NOF's existence, it was led by the former general and hero of the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia, Radola Gajda. In 1933 Gajda was briefly imprisoned and stripped of military rank and pension due to the so-called 'Zidenice Mutiny' scandal, a failed military coup done by certain fascist elements in the military.\n\nGajda was marginalized during the 1939-1945 occupation and abandoned politics. He occasionally assisted the Czech resistance by helping army officers flee into Poland and hiding his son's resistance activities. He was investigated by the Gestapo but avoided imprisonment.\n\nWhen World War II ended, Gajda was imprisoned by the NKVD and interrogated under harsh conditions. In April 1947, he was brought to trial for 'propagation of Fascism and Nazism', for which the prosecutor requested a life sentence. Gajda's guilt was far from clear, and the resulting sentence of two years allowed him to leave prison shortly after that. Penniless and forgotten, he died several months later."

Germans, Hungarians, and Jews were not allowed to become government members; however, the government would otherwise guarantee their civil rights.\n\nFurthermore, the NOF advocated restrictions on big businesses, cartels, and monopolies.

The British mediators were active in Czechoslovakia during the late summer, issuing their report shortly before the Munich Conference in September.\n\nThe report of the Runciman Mission, in the form of letters to the British and Czechoslovak prime ministers dated [GetDateText], was intensely hostile in tone towards the Czechoslovak Government and recommended the immediate transfer of the mainly German-inhabited territories to Germany. The 2000-word report firmly blamed the breakdown in negotiations on the SdP leadership, who used the pretext of civil unrest in some German areas to sever contacts. The report also noted that Beneš's 'Fourth Plan' proposals met "almost all the requirements" of the SdP's demands. Nevertheless, when itemizing the grievances of the German minority, Runciman expressed his sympathy for the Sudeten case observing that it was "a hard thing to be ruled by an alien race". Although declaring that Czech rule was "not actively oppressive, and certainly not 'terroristic'", the report alleged, "it was marked by tactlessness, lack of understanding, petty intolerance and discrimination".\n\nHowever, should the Czechoslovak government solve the Sudetenland problem before the escalation of the ethnic conflict, the report of the Runciman Mission would probably turn favorably for the Czech side.

When the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC) was finally established in the latter year, this outcome represented a compromise between the extreme, doctrinaire policies of the Comintern and the more moderate Czechoslovak-oriented views of Bohumil Smeral, the party's first leader.\n\nKSC organization was based on the Leninist concept of democratic centralism, which provided for the election of party leaders at all levels but required that each level be fully subject to the control of the next higher unit. Accordingly, party programs and policies were directed from the top, and resolutions of higher organs were unconditionally binding on all lower organs and individual party members. In theory, policy matters were freely and openly discussed at congresses, conferences, membership meetings, and party press. In practice, however, these discussions merely reflected decisions made by a small contingent of top party officials.\n\nIn 1929 Klement Gottwald became the party's Secretary-General after the purging from it of various oppositional elements, some of whom allied themselves to Lev Trotsky and the International Left Opposition.\n\nIn 1935 parliamentary election party held its original 30 mandates with little over 10% votes. However, the events of 1938 resulted in the party being banned, but it continued to exist as an underground organization.\n\nDuring World War II, many KSC leaders sought refuge in the Soviet Union, where they prepared to broaden the party's power base once the war ended.

The militias were hastily equipped and set on alert during the communist takeover of power at the end of February. They soon changed the name to People's Militias.\n\nThe task of the militias was to protect against guerrillas expected to appear after the takeover, against undercover agents sent to Czechoslovakia, and cooperate with the police and the army. About 3,000 militiamen joined police forces. Non-communists were slowly removed from the militias. The control over the militias went to the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nIn February 1948, the militias obtained 10,000 rifles and 2,000 submachine guns from the armament factory Zbrojovka Brno.

The Germans captured the plane in 1939, and it was examined and tested by the German engineers in Bremen, where it disappeared. \n\nAvia introduced a new light bomber aircraft, an advanced derivative of the previous B-158 prototype. The B.158 was a three-seat low-winged monoplane with inverted gull-wings, a retractable tailwheel undercarriage, and 634 kW (850 hp) Avia (Hispano-Suiza) 12Ydrs engines, which made its maiden flight in mid-1938. It had a better armament than A.300 but was slower.\n\n Czechoslovakia also had a number of old French and Dutch license-built strategic bombers, which were entirely outdated by 1936."

However, Masaryk's tenure is evidently nearing its end, as he has been beset by serious health issues, and the question of his heir to the presidency is bound to arise soon."

Some parliamentarians harbour doubts about his strategic competence, but his prowess as a party leader is widely acknowledged."

czechoslovakia.53.d:0 "The Praga company was founded in 1907 by František Ringhoffer. During the Great War, the company designed and supplied the Austro-Hungarian Army with various armoured cars and a versatile 4-tonne truck, which remained in service up until the Second World War.\n\nDuring the Interbellum years, the company became one of the most important tank engine producers, achieving a near monopoly on engine supplies. It also retained its prominent position on the truck market, as the Praga RV became quite popular first with the Czechoslovak army and then with the German and Romanian armies.\n\nWe could subsidise the research and development of a new tank engine, or we could place orders for new trucks and further motorize our army." #+#
czechoslovakia.53.a:0 "Increase motorisation efforts"
czechoslovakia.53.b:0 "Subsidize the development of a new tank engine"

czechoslovakia.54.t:0 "Modernising the Czechoslovak Fighters"
czechoslovakia.54.d:0 "The Avia business started developing a cutting-edge monoplane in 1935 as the Czechoslovak Air Force quickly realised the necessity to replace its biplane fighters. Because of the delayed progress, the Avia B.35's maiden test flight, which took place in September 1938 and showed off great flying characteristics, was followed by a tragedy that led to the destruction of the plane and the death of the test pilot. Following more delays, the company was eventually able to start producing the aircraft under the name Avia B.135. Bulgarian Air Force placed an order for 12 of these aircraft.\n\nDue to the enormous success of Avia's B-534 biplane fighters, the firm chose to advance the design; the B-634 prototype was finished by the middle of 1936. The extra 20 mm gun and even better aerodynamics were primarily what set it apart. Nevertheless, no orders for the B-634 were placed since the government preferred a modern monoplane fighter, and the Avia firm instead chose to concentrate on the troublesome Avia B-135.\n\nWe can decide to either try and expedite the B.135's development proccess, or we can try to prepare the B-634 for mass production" #+#
czechoslovakia.54.a:0 "We should continue developing the Avia B.135 monoplane"
czechoslovakia.54.b:0 "Converting the Avia B.634 would be easier and faster"

czechoslovakia.55.t:0 "Artillery Citadels"
czechoslovakia.55.d:0 "Amongst the fortifications of Czechoslovakia the most important were the Artillery Citadels, constructed within natural terrain features, whereby artillery batteries could safeguard the adjacent terrain. These Citadels, robustly fashioned from reinforced concrete and steel, were resistant to enemy bombardment, whilst their concealed entrances served to augment their security. Within, the artillery batteries were equipped with the latest in advanced technology and equipment, enabling the provision of overlapping fields of fire to counteract any adversary's attempts at forward progression. These Citadels played a pivotal role in the defence strategy of Czechoslovakia and were deemed to be amongst the most sophisticated fortifications across Europe.\n\nBouda, the first fortress, boasted a depth of 40 meters and was armed with 150 mm and 75 mm guns, in addition to smaller ordnance. Furthermore, it was connected to other edifices via a well-established fortress railway.\n\nDobrošov, erected between 1935 and 1938, was endowed with a depth of 70 meters and was fortified with several layers of walls and defences. Regrettably, although it was furnished with 150 mm and 75 mm anti-tank guns, its artillery turrets were incompletely constructed.\n\nStachelberg was designed to be self-sufficient, with its water supply and power generators. Its citadel boasted a depth of 57 meters and was connected to above-ground structures via a network of more than 8 kilometres of underground railway. It was further fortified with an impressive array of 305 mm and 150 mm howitzers, anti-aircraft guns, and machine guns for close-in defence.\n\nBerghöhe, crafted to safeguard Olomouc, was designed to have large artillery casemates, which would house 150mm howitzers, as well as several smaller bunkers and machine gun nests for close-in defense.\n\nLastly, Grünwald, anticipated to be one of the most advanced citadels, was conceived with walls up to 6 meters thick and planned to house 305 mm and 150 mm howitzers." #+++
czechoslovakia.55.a:0 "Finish the construction of the main Citadels"

czechoslovakia.56.t:0 "The President-Parlament split in Czechoslovakia"
czechoslovakia.56.d:0 "Ever since its inception under the visionary leadership of T. G. Masaryk in the aftermath of the Great War, Czechoslovakia has been a highly centralized state. President Masaryk, who held the reins of power from 1918 till the end of 1935, consolidated an enormous amount of power in his presidential office, which included various ministries answerable only to him. This concentration of power became known as the Castle (Hrad in Czech), and the struggle for supremacy between the Castle and the Parliament, which attempted to limit the President's power, marked the entire interwar period of Czechoslovak internal politics. The Castle remained the bastion of conservatism and Czech nationalism, staunchly opposing any radical reforms, whether from the right or the left.\n\nThe newly elected President, Eduard Beneš, has pledged to break away from this tradition and give greater autonomy to the nationalities of Czechoslovakia. However, it remains to be seen whether his promises can be trusted, given that he was one of the closest associates of the old President and most of his promises were made only in order to garner support for his presidency. It is a fact that without the support of the Slovak Milan Hodža, Beneš would not have been able to ascend to the presidency. In any case, with Masaryk largely out of the picture, the government now has the power to complicate the life of the Hrad, should it choose to do so."
czechoslovakia.56.a:0 "Beneš is Masaryk's chosen successor. We would be foolish not to trust him"
czechoslovakia.56.b:0 "We should take out the Hrad from politics"

czechoslovakia.57.t:0 "Espionage scandal"
czechoslovakia.57.d:0 "With the recent scandals that have exposed the deep Hungarian infiltration into our army, members of the 2nd Section of the Intelligence Agency, charged with counterintelligence, are advocating for a broad inquiry into senior army generals who may have harboured sympathies for the Habsburg Empire and served in the Austro-Hungarian army while refusing to join the Czechoslovak legions.\n\nAt the same time, there is reason to believe that certain politicians may have close affiliations with foreign powers. An inquiry into these individuals may serve to demonstrate the competency of our intelligence service.\n\nHowever, there are compelling arguments to avoid overreacting and instead proceed with the status quo, in the hope that further infiltration may be averted."
czechoslovakia.57.a:0 "We cannot risk it. Investigate the generals"
czechoslovakia.57.b:0 "Investigating the Autonomist Party leaders will be easy"
czechoslovakia.57.c:0 "We shouldn't overreact"

czechoslovakia.58.t:0 "Army Investigations"
czechoslovakia.58.d:0 "As the investigation nears its conclusion, regrettably, no conclusive evidence has been found to incriminate those suspected of collusion with foreign powers. Nevertheless, the abundance of circumstantial evidence may be deemed sufficient for a conviction, though it falls to us to determine who shall shoulder the brunt of the blame for these transgressions."
czechoslovakia.58.a:0 "Jaroslav Eminger will have to retire"
czechoslovakia.58.b:0 "Josef Köppl will be demoted"
czechoslovakia.58.c:0 "Josef Votruba shall be forced into pension"

czechoslovakia.59.t:0 "Political Investigations"
czechoslovakia.59.d:0 "As the investigation draws to a close, it has become apparent that János Esterházy has been in contact with the Hungarian government, receiving funds for his autonomist party. While no direct evidence of the transfer of state secrets has been discovered, the available evidence is sufficient to warrant his arrest. In addition to Esterházy, journalist and politician Erwin Zajiček, who has been campaigning ardently for greater Sudeten autonomy, may also be sent away from the country, as some of his writings may potentially be in violation of Law 201."
czechoslovakia.59.a:0 "Arrest Esterházy"
czechoslovakia.59.b:0 "Deport Zajiček"

czechoslovakia.60.t:0 "Top-secret information leaked"
czechoslovakia.60.d:0 "After concluding our investigation, it was found that the situation is far more dire than we had anticipated. Our agent in the Abwehr A-51 has brought to our attention that the Germans are now in possession of highly classified information, including the top-secret plans of our North-Eastern fortifications and even our mobilisation strategies. With assistance from A-51 we have traced the leak to Captain Edmund Kalmar, stationed at the headquarters of the 4th division. The 2nd Section was able to apprehend Kalmar, who was subsequently sentenced to death for his treacherous actions. Furthermore, we have also discovered the presence of another Hungarian agent, Lieutenant Colonel Alois Wünsch of the construction directorate of 3rd corps in Brno. Wünsch was found guilty of transferring sensitive information about our southern defences to Hungarian authorities and was also sentenced to death."
czechoslovakia.60.a:0 "Where was the 2nd Section looking?"

czechoslovakia.61.t:0 "Hlinka makes a neutral speech"
czechoslovakia.61.d:0 "During the 7th HSĽS party congress held today, Hlinka delivered a speech reaffirming the significance of upholding Slovak identity, embracing faith in the Almighty, and displaying steadfast resistance towards communists and Jews. Fortunately, it appears that Hlinka's speech did not contain any overtly negative remarks about our government. Nonetheless, it is imperative that we remain vigilant and keep a watchful eye on any developments that may transpire in the autonomist block."
czechoslovakia.61.a:0 "At least he didn't say anything too bad about us"

czechoslovakia.62.t:0 "Hlinka condems the Czech government"
czechoslovakia.62.d:0 "At the 7th HSĽS party congress that took place today, Hlinka gave a speech wherein he vehemently condemned our government for failing to fulfil its commitments to the Autonomist Block. During the congress, he proclaimed a declaration which asserted Slovakia's right to broad autonomy, implying that it is merely a matter of time before Slovakia gains independence. Hlinka's speech has already sparked considerable commotion in Prague."
czechoslovakia.62.a:0 "That was worse than we expected"

czechoslovakia.63.t:0 "Karol Sidor gives a speech at the Comenius University"
czechoslovakia.63.d:0 "In November 1937, Karol Sidor delivered a passionate speech that inflamed the students of Bratislava, inspiring them to stage a demonstration in the streets. They chanted slogans such as "Slovak in Slovakia", with many of them adorning the HSĽS party badges."
czechoslovakia.63.a:0 "Why do they have to do that?"

czechoslovakia.66.t:0 "The February Memorandum"
czechoslovakia.66.d:0 "On January 27, 1937, the leader of the Sudeten German Social-Democratic Party, Wanzel Jaksch, submitted the reformation plan directly to Milan Hodža, who swiftly agreed to sign it. The plan had the following provisions:\n\nFirstly, the Sudeten Germans were to become the second nationality with state-forming status, after the "Czechoslovak" nationality.\n\nSecondly, the state was obligated to assist the unemployed Sudeten Germans, as the unemployment rate in the Sudetenland was up to three times higher than in the Czech regions.\n\nThirdly, proportional representation of Germans was to be ensured in local governments.\n\nLastly, the discriminatory 52nd Language Law was to be abolished, which had made Czech language compulsory for use in the Parliament and for all civil servants, and the Austro-Hungarian practice of multilingualism was to be reinstated in the Parliament.\n\nUnfortunately, the implementation of this plan was beset by active protests from the Beneš's Castle and Czech nationalist parties and was never finished."
czechoslovakia.66.a:0 "It is better than nothing"

czechoslovakia.67.t:0 "Tiso complains about the government"
czechoslovakia.67.d:0 "At the 8th HSĽS party congress held today, Tiso, who took over the party leadership after Hlinka's death, delivered a speech as anticipated, in which he expressed his grievances about the central government, acknowledging that some advancements had been made but that they were still inadequate and progressing at a sluggish pace. Considering the fact that except for these complaints, which were bound to happen anyway, no other comments were made, we can count ourselves lucky."
czechoslovakia.67.a:0 "It could have been much worse"

czechoslovakia.68.t:0 "Tiso demands autonomy"
czechoslovakia.68.d:0 "At the 8th HSĽS party congress held today, Tiso, who assumed the party leadership after Hlinka's passing, delivered an impassioned speech that led to the swift acceptance of a resolution by the party. The resolution demanded extensive autonomy in accordance with the Pittsburgh Agreement, which was drafted before the establishment of the Czechoslovak state. This resolution has made the new in Prague and the tensions are running high now."
czechoslovakia.68.a:0 "That is bad"

CZE_hun_parties_unification_desc:0 "On June 21, 1936, several Hungarian parties came together to form a unified autonomist party called OKSP, the Provincial Christian-Socialist Party. This move served to consolidate their power and strengthen their political influence."

CZE_amend_the_201_law_desc:0 "On October 25, 1933, Masaryk's Castle passed Law 201, also known as the "Law concerning suspension of activities and dissolution of political parties". This law granted the central government the power to dissolve or suspend any political organisation that was deemed to "gravely endanger" the state, with no possibility of appeal. While completley abolishing it may not be in our interests, we could still amend it to be less antidemocratic.\n§WCompleted promises:§! §Y[?benes_promises]§! §Wout of§! §Y5§!"

CZE_increase_slovak_funding:0 "§OIncrease governmental funding of the Slovak lands§!"
CZE_increase_slovak_funding_desc:0 "The creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 highlighted a significant problem - the enormous difference between the Cisleithanian and the Transleithanian parts of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Some have said that this difference amounted to about 50 years. The Czechoslovak government's laissez-faire attitude has only exacerbated this gap, leading to growing disillusionment among Slovaks who feel exploited by Prague without receiving any benefits in return. To address this, the central government should increase funding for local projects and begin the process of reconciliation with the Slovak population."

CZE_investigate_hungarian_spies_army:0 "Investigate reports of infiltration into the army"
CZE_investigate_hungarian_spies_army_desc:0 "Verily, the intelligence department's agents have received information that the Chief of Staff of the Regional Military Command in Prague has been infiltrated by Hungarian spies. Captain Vilém Tikal, a man of suspicion, was the foremost culprit. A thorough search of his home and a rigorous interrogation validated the claim that he had been imparting confidential information to the Hungarian intelligence service. Regrettably, Tikal was discovered dead, having been hanged in his cell. However, the investigation must continue, for there may yet be more subversive elements lurking within the ranks of the army."

CZE_further_investigation_into_hungarian_spies:0 "Further investigation of Hungarian spies in the army"
CZE_further_investigation_into_hungarian_spies_desc:0 "While some hoped that V. Tikal was just one isolated occurence it seems that the Hungarian infiltration into our army is much deeper than was previously thought. A series of arrests of high rated officers rang through the army, including that of Captain Wilhelm Ketzern of the 10th Infantry Regiment in October. Later, Staff Sergeant Major Josef Krejz of the artillery section 252 was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by a firing squad. During his interrogation, Krejz revealed the name of Bohumil Opočenský, the chief of staff of the 5 division, as a possible co-conspirator. However, Opočenský passed away during questioning, reportedly due to a heart failure.  We must investigate how far has this infiltration gone before any sensitive information gets leaked."

CZE_arm_sokol_paras:0 "Arm the Sokol Paramilitaries"
CZE_arm_sokol_paras_desc:0 "The Sokol organisation has maintained a paramilitary contingent, comprised of strong young men, with no access to substantive armaments. However, if the group were to be equipped with weapons, the government would be in possession of a potent instrument within the realm of semi-sanctioned paramilitary operations, thereby affording a credible basis for action, in the event of violent exigencies."

CZE_ban_turnverbund:0 "Ban the Turnverbund"
CZE_ban_turnverbund_desc:0 "The Turnverbund, a German gymnastics league akin to the Czech Sokol, enjoyes a close association with the SdP. It is apparent that the organisation harbours an adversarial stance towards our government and serves as a breeding ground for radicalisation. Therefore, we ought to contemplate prohibiting it, notwithstanding the likelihood of provoking a hostile response from its adherents."

Should the commitments made to the autonomists be fulfilled, we may emerge unscathed. However, if these undertakings are not honoured, Hlinka will undoubtedly express his strong disapproval and advance his autonomist agenda."

CZE_sdp_frank_radicalising_desc:0 "From the outset, K. Henlein leaned towards the Austrofascist concepts of Dr. O. Spann, but Karl Herman Frank is an explicit proponent of the Hitler's version of the ideology. As the country becomes more volatile, it may be simpler for Frank to draw the party towards the far-right."

czechoslovakia_bop.1.t:0 "Freikorps Insurrection"
czechoslovakia_bop.1.d:0 "The Sudetendeutsches Freikorps were a paramilitary entity constituted of ethnic Germans residing in the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia during the Interbellum period.\n\nThe Freikorps committed a string of border clashes with the Czechoslovak forces, including sabotage of military and state-owned properties, abductions, and targeted killings. These clashes culminated in the undeclared German-Czechoslovak War of 1938, which persisted from September 17 to October 10, 1938. During the hostilities, the Freikorps fought in conjunction with German forces and played an influential role in securing the Sudetenland for Nazi Germany. The "war" was concluded with the signing of the Munich Dictate on October 10, 1938, which transferred Sudetenland to Germany.\n\nAfter the hostilities, the Freikorps were integrated into the German military and discontinued as an autonomous entity. Many of its members fought in the Wehrmacht during the World War II"
