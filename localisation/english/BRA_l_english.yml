 bra.1.d:0 "As we finally stand on the brink of re-democratization, we must choose who will be our leader for the next five years. Adhemar de Barros is the former interventor for São Paulo: He built roads, expanded the industries, and rebuilt the state. Armando Sales is a long fighter for democracy: He governed São Paulo, giving the state's the continent's higher educational standards. The brigadier Eduardo Gomes is a former member of the Brazilian Air Force: He has become the central figure for the still-standing Tenentistas. Júlio Prestes was elected president in 1930, having been the one deposed in the 1930's Coup: He is a member of the Agrarian Elite and the former head of the PRP. The time has come for us to make our decisions."

After Field Marshal Dutra and General Goes Monteiro pressured congress to declare the state of siege, His Excellency has decided to close congress altogether. Thus, he proclaimed the new constitution, tearing the second one in 7 years.

It was actually the second plantation in the country as the first one Fordlandia closed in 1934. The new one was supposed to be more profitable by planting the Eveas closer together, increasing the production per unit of surface. But this practice seems to have backfired as a contagious disease has suddenly ravaged almost the entire plantation, blocking the production for at least five years. It seems that plantation rubber won't be able to contribute its resources to the production of military equipment in the near future unless people are sent to collect wild rubber, a way more arduous work."
