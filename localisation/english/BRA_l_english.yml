[BRA.GetNameDefCap] is not a country formed by different cultures that inhabit the same space but by a single [BRA.GetAdjective] culture, organized through the hybridization of European, African, Asian, and indigenous cultures. A [BRA.GetAdjective], therefore, can not be identified through race or custom, but only through the use of the mother tongue and the sense of belonging to [BRA.GetNameDef]. This peculiarity built a disenchanted people and a disinterested government when it comes to external affairs, but highly resilient and tolerant of other cultures and citizens loyal to the [BRA.GetAdjective] uniqueness."

 bra.1.t:0 "A Famosa Caixinha do Adhemar"
 bra.1.d:0 "As we finally stand on the brink of re-democratization, we must choose who will be our leader for the next five years. Adhemar de Barros is the former interventor for São Paulo: He built roads, expanded the industries, and rebuilt the state. Armando Sales is a long fighter for democracy: He governed São Paulo, giving the state's the continent's higher educational standards. The brigadier Eduardo Gomes is a former member of the Brazilian Air Force: He has become the central figure for the still-standing Tenentistas. Júlio Prestes was elected president in 1930, having been the one deposed in the 1930's Coup: He is a member of the Agrarian Elite and the former head of the PRP. The time has come for us to make our decisions."
 bra.1.a:0 "If he rebuilt São Paulo, why can't he rebuild [BRA.GetNameDef]?"
 bra.1.b:0 "For our democracy, we need someone that has never given up on it."
 bra.1.c:0 "What I don't understand is how a nation, like Brazil, after years of democratic tradition, could retrograde to a dictatorship that humiliates us in the eyes of the civilized world!"
 bra.1.e:0 "To us, wisdom is constructed through the consequences of our choices."
 bra.1.f:0 "The future is not what we fear; it is what we dare to reach!"

 bra.2:0 "The Cohen Plan"
 bra.2.t:0 "The Cohen Plan"
 bra.2.d:0 "Through Captain Mourão, a document, theoretically written by the ANL, has arrived in your hands. It contains a well detailed plan to assassinate the candidates for the 1938's election, Armando Sales and José Américo. An action must be taken by us, even though our intelligence services can't deduct the veracity of the document."
 bra.2.a:0 "Bring the microphone! We can't afford to lose more time."
 bra.2.b:0 "Arrest the Captain and burn the document! This farce can't become endemic."
 bra.2.c:0 "We must adjust the political organism to the necessities of the fatherland."
 bra.2.e:0 "We can't deprive them of their freedoms in response to a document that is likely false!"

 bra.3:0 "Congress Disbanded!"
 bra.3.t:0 "Congress Disbanded!"
 bra.3.d:0 "Given the communist threat presented to us by the most excellent Captain Mourão, President Getúlio Vargas decided to take the final measure necessary to prevent a future socialist coup in federal territory. After Field Marshal Dutra and General Goes Monteiro pressured congress to declare the state of siege, His Excellency has decided to close congress altogether. Thus, he proclaimed the new constitution, tearing the second one in 7 years. The Polaca will expand the powers of the President, criminalize political parties, and dismantle the socialist forces within the national congress."
 bra.3.a:0 "We are answering the legitimate aspirations of the [BRA.GetAdjective] people."

 bra.5:0 "The Emperor of Brazil"
 bra.5.t:0 "The Emperor of Brazil"
 bra.5.d:0 "Now that the Emperor was acclaimed by his people, his ideology came into question. The Integralists claim that the Emperor is an expansionist and visionary who will restore Brazil to glory. The others state that the Emperor, despite any ideology, must be prudent and moderate above all else. Who's right?"
 bra.5.b:0 "For Christ's sake, he's an Emperor, not a politician!"
 bra.5.a:0 "An Emperor must be wise and prudent, above all else."

 bra.10:0 "Oh Dear Motherland"
 bra.10.t:0 "Oh Dear Motherland"
 bra.10.d:0 "It is the year 1936, the 114th of Independence and 47th of the Republic. Six years ago, Mr. Getúlio Vargas assumed this honorable position as President of the Republic of the United States of Brazil. In the latter, the Civil War was seen in 32, followed by the rapid industrialization of the Noble State of São Paulo. At this moment, in the first steps of its industrialization, [BRA.GetNameDef] disputes with its inferior neighbors for the control of the South Atlantic. In Europe, [GER.GetLeader] woke [GER.GetNameDef] and promised salvation. In [USA.GetNameDef], the crisis kills many by starvation and leaves many others with no place to live. In Africa and Asia, [FRA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetNameDef] are struggling to keep their empires alive. It is our time to perish or to rule. Glory to [BRA.GetNameDef]!"

 bra.12.t:0 "Ripping the Green and Yellow"
 bra.12.d:0 "As the new national government is formed, under the sole guidance of our politicians and our people, the Federal-installed state retreats, seeking exile in mainland Brazil. With it goes their twisted ideology, imposed on us throughout our time as subjects of the DIP. Now, our destiny is ours."
 bra.12.a:0 "Free! At Last!"
 
 bra.13:0 "Vargas Murdered!"
 bra.13.t:0 "Vargas Murdered!"
 bra.13.d:0 "During the supreme manifestation of the liberation of the Proletariat, dozens of supporters, supported by thousands more in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, surrounded and invaded the Palácio do Cacete. In a few hours, the bourgeois chief Getúlio Vargas was dead, and Mr. Luís Carlos Prestes was declared the republic's new president."
 bra.13.a:0 "Do svidaniya, mister Vargas."
 
 bra.14:0 "Vargas Exiled!"
 bra.14.t:0 "Vargas Exiled!"
 bra.14.d:0 "During the supreme manifestation of citizenship of all peoples and races, thousands of Integralists surrounded and threatened to invade the Palácio do Cacete.

 bra.14.a:0 "Anauê!"
 
 bra.15:0 "Vargas Entrenched!"
 bra.15.t:0 "Vargas Entrenched!"
 bra.15.d:0 "Created to coordinate the propaganda of the National State, the Department of Press and Propaganda, associated with the intelligence sectors of the federal government, will guarantee the perpetuation of the President of the Republic, Mr. Getúlio Vargas, in power."
 bra.15.a:0 "The Constitutional Regime has lost its practical value."
 
 bra.16:0 "Vargas Impeached!"
 bra.16.t:0 "Vargas Impeached!"
 bra.16.d:0 "During the supreme manifestation of freedom of the Fatherland, the Associated Sectors of the Army, Navy, and Air Force surrounded the Palácio do Cacete in support of the National Congress. In a few hours, Mr. Getúlio Vargas would give the Republic back to the National Congress and the [BRA.GetAdjective] people under pressure from a select body of generals and admirals."
 bra.16.a:0 "To us mortals, wisdom is built through the consequences of our choices."
