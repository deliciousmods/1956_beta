 bftb_news.204.desc:0 "A civil war has broken out in [TUR.GetNameDef] between the ruling conservative government and the formerly reigning Kemalists. The Kemalists, who fought and secured [TUR.GetNameDef]'s independence after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, have named the current government's numerous flagrant violations of the constitution as reason enough to topple their regime. Celebrity general and avowed Kemalist Kâzım Orbay has been elected to lead a military junta that intends to unseat the current Islamist government of [TUR.GetLeader].\n[TUR.GetLeader] has condemned the move of the Kemalists as ill-fitting of a truly functional democratic country and has vowed to restore the rule of law to his fractured nation. Neither side is willing to negotiate, and it remains too early to predict an outcome."

 bftb_news.205.desc:0 "Much to the entire world's dismay, the Ottoman Sultan has been restored to his throne after a ferocious civil war between the country's conservatives and its secularist Kemalists. In an extravagant ceremony that seemed straight out of the Medieval Ages, the Sultan was restored to his former position, and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's republic was dissolved forever.\n\n[TUR.GetLeader] addressed his newly reborn sultanate, expressing a mix of surprise and humility that he should even be in that position: addressing the nation. The new Sultan is a mild-mannered man but is surrounded by a court of warmongers and irredentists. Experts, who never believed the Sultan's return was even possible, are clueless about what the future could hold."

 bftb_news.206.desc:0 "[ITA.GetLeader] and [TUR.GetLeader] have announced the creation of a new alliance bloc in the Mediterranean, known as the '[TUR.GetFactionName].' [ITA.GetLeader] pledged that their pact would dominate all European affairs as the preeminent leaders of the European continent. [TUR.GetLeader] spoke in more measured terms assuring diplomats that the alliance was purely a strategic one designed to increase security in the Balkans and the Mediterranean nations.\n\n[ENG.GetAdjective] officials dubbed the new regional force as 'unhelpful and unwelcome'. The [GER.GetAdjective] observers spoke in decidedly more absolute terms by predicting that the faction would be little more than a footnote in history by the end of the decade."

 bftb_news.207.desc:0 "[TUR.GetLeader] addressed the world today when he declared that Turkey would be looking to expand on its Balkan-centric foreign policy by guaranteeing all cooperative nations' independence. To international observers, it would appear that Turkey has taken a more decisive stance in choosing to minimize dealings with great powers to focus on regional security.\nAlthough some have praised the [TUR.GetAdjective] decision, it is the source of considerable consternation for others. [ITA.GetAdjective] officials, in particular, have reacted with some alarm, begging the [TUR.GetAdjective] government to recant their position if they wish to minimize the chance of conflict breaking out in the region. The [TUR.GetAdjective] government, in reply, labeled [ITA.GetNameDef] a 'regional antagonist.'"

The [TUR.GetAdjective] government has made claims on nearly all neighboring states and has rejected calls to retract its spurious claims.\nThe international community has widely condemned the [TUR.GetAdjective] administration for its decision. There is a general global concern that reckless actions by the [TUR.GetAdjective] leadership may only serve to agitate the global ravaging the world has felt over the last few years.

The debut of this new empire has sparked shock across the world, as there were very few observers who believed that Turkey would even be capable of fully recovering from its War of Independence in the following decades - let alone establishing an entirely new empire that spanned continents.\n\nIf reports are to be believed, the newly formed [TUR.GetNameDef] may still not be finished with its rapid expansion, with [TUR.GetLeader] stating that it shall never cease their conquests until every Turk in the world has been liberated. The world can only continue to watch with bated breath."
