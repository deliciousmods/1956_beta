 ukraine.1.t:0 "Ukraine Declares Independence"
 ukraine.1.d:0 "While the Red Army was fully mobilized to bring down the insurgency of Vlasov's white forces, Ukraine was considered of little importance and unlikely to be able to revolt as a result of the many pacifications that took place in the region.\n\nIt seems that we have underestimated the impact that the revolt had on the region, as Soviet flags have already begun to be taken down and replaced by the blue and yellow flag and an emergency government, meeting in Kiev, has unilaterally declared the recreation of the Ukrainian People's Republic.\n\nIt now seems obvious that the region can only be taken over by force."
 ukraine.1.a:0 "These traitors will Be brought down!"
 ukraine.1.b:0 "Making peace is the best choice."

 ukraine.2.t:0 "Peace With Ukraine"
 ukraine.2.d:0 "What was a simple insurrection has turned into a real war of independence for Ukraine. Our soldiers have been unable to secure Kiev and the Ukrainian army is now sufficiently organised to start entering territory that until then was under our control.\n\nWe cannot afford to continue a war that has already cost us so much, so we have invited the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the provisional Ukrainian government to negotiate a peace between our two nations, recognizing Ukraine's independence and transferring to them any territory they consider Ukrainian and which is in their hands."
 ukraine.2.a:0 "We shall have peace"
 ukraine.2.b:0 "Never! Ukraine shall stay Soviet!"

 ukraine.3.t:0 "A Ukrainian Compromise?"
 ukraine.3.desc:0 "The [UKR.GetAdjective] government suggests the establishment of a Ukrainian condominium in Volhynia-Eastern Galicia. It would grant autonomy to the Ukrainian population in Western Ukraine, resolving the ethnic tensions between the Ukrainian and the Polish communities. In addition to the local autonomy, the Ukrainians are demanding some economic concessions."
 ukraine.3.a:0 "A small concession in the grand scheme of things."
 ukraine.3.b:0 "Poland will not be divided."

 ukraine.4.t:0 "Poland Accepted our Proposal."
 ukraine.4.desc:0 "Following our request, Poland Established an autonomous region in Western Ukraine. [DOU.GetNameDefCap] has been established. While it's still technically outside of Ukraine, it will ensure equal rights for all and allow us to go further in our collaboration with the Poles, all while keeping the most nationalistic elements of the OUN relatively quiet."
