 cityfall.1.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.1.d:0 "Victorious [USA.GetAdjective] soldiers march through the streets of London after fierce fighting for most of the day. Although they preserved most of the city's monuments in the battle, the Tower Bridge was destroyed after retreating [ENG.GetAdjective] troops attempted to break out over the Thames across the bridge, [USA.GetAdjective] airstrikes destroying the middle of the bridge before they could reach the other side.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes have now replaced the Union Jack, and [USA.GetLeader] is scheduled to give a speech where once was Buckingham Palace. An empire wanes while another rises."

 cityfall.2.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.2.d:0 "In the mind of all good Britons everywhere, the worst-case scenario has befallen the great nation. The defenders of London have fought nearly to a man against the oncoming [FRA.GetAdjective] legions, but after bitter fighting and the defeat of brave Home Guard units, London has fallen. Even now, gunfire can still be heard across the city as brave Londoners continue to resist the armies of their greatest nemesis.\n\nDespite the attempts of the [ENG.GetAdjective] army and the people of London, however, [FRA.GetAdjective] forces control enough of the streets that nobody can genuinely defy [FRA.GetAdjective] control over the city. The Tricolore is now flying above the ruins of the Buckingham Palace, and for the first time in a millennium, [FRA.GetAdjective] is now the lingua franca of London."
 cityfall.2.a:0 "History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes."
 cityfall.2.b:0 "Die, perfidious Albion!"

 cityfall.3.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.3.d:0 "In a move that has shocked the many peoples of the world, [POL.GetAdjective] soldiers have taken London. After a daring raid by [POL.GetAdjective] cavalry, which destroyed most of the local defender's ammunition stores, [POL.GetAdjective] troops used the London metro and old sewer systems to sneak behind enemy lines. Before the defenders had time to counterattack, multiple [POL.GetAdjective] squadrons had already appeared within the city limits, and large portions of the garrison were surrendering within only a few hours.\n\nSome of the defenders have stored away some ammo. They now resist the [POL.GetAdjective] invaders in certain areas, gunshots still being heard near the Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London, with [POL.GetAdjective] crack units already dealing with the remaining resistance."

 cityfall.4.d:0 "As the Rising Sun rises ever higher, another sun may finally set in the British Isles. The Hinomaru already flies from every abbey and tower across London, now renamed Daishori, and [JAP.GetAdjective] officials have already established a transitional administration to handle their new conquest.\nAlready, dissenters have been gathered up and driven off in the middle of the night, and the [ENG.GetAdjective] units who have surrendered have begun a march to new camps being built for them in the countryside. Several local [ENG.GetAdjective] leaders have been offered seppuku to atone for their failure, and due to the possibility of resistance rallying around them, the offer was not voluntary. Buckingham Palace has already been chosen for renovations to become one of the Emperor's new seasonal residences after the war is over."

 cityfall.5.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.5.d:0 "To the backdrop of a burning London, [SPR.GetAdjective] troops now raise [SPR.GetNameDef]'s red and gold flag over the city. The harbor burned in a cruel reversal of the burning of the [SPR.GetAdjective] armada back in 1588. The fighting was hard-fought across the city, [SPR.GetAdjective] troops facing stiff resistance street by street, but in the end, the [SPR.GetAdjective] invaders have finally broken the last of the [ENG.GetAdjective] lines and now only face sparse resistance around the city's outer limits.\n\n[SPR.GetLeader] himself has been flown out to London in his private plane and will be giving a speech to the assorted [SPR.GetAdjective] soldiers on their gallantry within the hour. Afterward, he'll address to the people of London on what is to be expected for them in the coming days."

 cityfall.5.b:0 "A mistake was finally corrected."
 cityfall.5.c:0 "The battle for London may be over, but the war for Britain is not lost yet!"
 cityfall.6.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.6.d:0 "Earlier today, the fall of the Reich Chancellery marked the end of an epic battle through the war-torn streets of Berlin. [JAP.GetAdjective] soldiers have raised the Hinomaru over the ruined building, the corpses of its defenders littering the building and roads around it, and twice as many [JAP.GetAdjective] soldiers had perished.\n\nThe battle for the Reichstag was comparatively short after a [GER.GetAdjective] plane lost control and slammed into the building, its fuel tanks tearing apart most of the heavily fortified defenses in it. With the Reich Chancellery gone, only a handful of [GER.GetAdjective] units remain bunkered down in the Gendarmenmarkt Konzerthaus. However, [JAP.GetAdjective] troops have already breached into the outer rooms of the building."
 cityfall.6.a:0 "So much for the "Thousand Year Reich"."

 cityfall.6.c:0 "The enemy shall be crushed, no matter the cost!"
 cityfall.7.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.7.d:0 "Although a fierce tank battle is still happening across the Ackerstraße, in the rest of the city, [GER.GetAdjective] soldiers have begun either retreating or making their last stand in the face of the victorious [SPR.GetAdjective] troops.\n\nThe battle, which has seen much of the old city destroyed and left most of the city's road unusable, was won after a concentrated effort by [SPR.GetAdjective] forces to take on the U-Bahn, with the [GER.GetAdjective] defenders being taken by surprise by the [SPR.GetAdjective] push underground.\n\nNow with the last of the organized defenses stamped out, it seems that [GER.GetNameDef] stands on its last legs."
 cityfall.7.a:0 "Who could have foreseen this?"
 cityfall.7.b:0 "Plus ultra!"
 cityfall.7.c:0 "We will not surrender until our last soldier lies dead!"
 cityfall.8.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.8.d:0 "[YUG.GetAdjective] authorities already plan for a grand ceremony down the Kurfürstendamm, having ended the fighting in the city earlier today. [GER.GetAdjective] forces held out for hours on end, hunkering down in any fortifiable building they could find, one of them being the Zoo flak tower. But in the end, it didn't matter, and the flag of [YUG.GetNameDef] already can be seen hanging from various surviving landmarks across the city.\n\nWhat this means for [GER.GetNameDef] remains to be seen, but most foresee the war ending in a victory for [YUG.GetNameDef]."
 cityfall.8.a:0 "On the [GER.GetAdjective] back now lies a Slavic yoke."
 cityfall.8.b:0 "A historic day for all the people of [YUG.GetNameDef]!"
 cityfall.8.c:0 "We will never bend our knee to Slavs!"
 cityfall.9.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.9.d:0 "After an explosive end to a day of fighting, the [CZE.GetAdjective] government announced that the country's armed forces now have decisive control over the capital city of Berlin.\n\nAfter a day of fighting across the entirety of the city, which unfortunately leveled many of its landmarks such as the Victory Column, resistance remains heavily active underground, with [GER.GetAdjective] militias and proper units still holding out. But [CZE.GetAdjective] forces have kept on detonating the bulkheads under the Landwehr Canal, hoping to drown the last of the defenders who refuse to surrender."
 cityfall.9.a:0 "A "Thousand-Year Reich", they said?"
 cityfall.9.b:0 "March on, brothers, for only we will prevail!"
 cityfall.9.c:0 "We will never surrender; to the front lines!"
 cityfall.10.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.10.d:0 "Perhaps the final nail was struck into the coffin of [GER.GetNameDef] today when [ITA.GetAdjective] troops, weary yet unendingly determined in their attacks, finally managed to reach the roof of the Reichstag. Il Tricolore was raised shortly after, and [ITA.GetAdjective] troops have now begun clearing the last redoubts of [GER.GetAdjective] resistance in the city.\n\nTrains of prisoners have already begun their travel through the rails to POW camps in the suburbs, and [ITA.GetAdjective] soldiers have already begun setting up soup kitchens and outposts around the city to begin its long road to recovery."
 cityfall.10.a:0 "A revenge a millennium in the making."
 cityfall.10.b:0 "Veni, vidi, vici."
 cityfall.10.c:0 "Roma will never rule over Germania!"
 cityfall.11.t:0 "The Fall of Stockholm"
 cityfall.11.d:0 "Stockholm, the capital of [SWE.GetNameDef], has fallen after heavy fighting for most of the day. The local [SWE.GetAdjective] forces had turned the island of Stadsholmen into a fortress and fought fiercely to hold the [GER.GetAdjective]s out. Yet they were finally forced to withdraw after a massive artillery barrage laid waste to their lines.\n\nAlthough [SWE.GetAdjective] troops hoped to stall them further, demolition charges on the Vasabron failed to detonate, and the [GER.GetAdjective]s managed to overwhelm the last of the defenders shortly after. The [GER.GetAdjective]s eliminated the last pockets of resistance today, and the [GER.GetAdjective] flag now waves from the Rosenbad building."
 cityfall.11.a:0 "Is no one safe?"
 cityfall.11.b:0 "Scandinavia shall feel our might!"
 cityfall.11.c:0 "Brave Swedes, fight on!"
 cityfall.12.t:0 "The Fall of Stockholm"
 cityfall.12.d:0 "The Red Army, after battling their way down the Sveavägen and into Stockholm proper, has taken the city after fighting for most of the day. [SWE.GetAdjective] militias still fight on in the city's outer boroughs, and the remaining trained units fortified themselves in the Stockholm Palace, but otherwise, the battle for Stockholm is over.\n\nThe country's leadership has escaped, hurried away after the opening shots were fired, but [SWE.GetNameDef] has been shaken to its very core, and the Red Banner is now hung from every important building in the city. Those with sympathies for their new overlords have already emerged from obscurity while the Red Army teams support their respective militias."
 cityfall.12.a:0 "The shadow of communism now looms over Scandinavia."
 cityfall.12.b:0 "The workers of Sweden stand with us, onward comrades!"
 cityfall.12.c:0 "As long as we fight, we shall never fall!"
 cityfall.13.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.13.d:0 "To the sound of deafening artillery fire, the field marshal leading the army that captured Berlin for good has given a speech from the remains of the Brandenburg Gate. After a fierce battle which had consumed the city until only a few hours prior, and which, in the city's outer boroughs and her U-Bahn, is still being fought, [CHI.GetAdjective] forces successfully stormed the Reichstag.\n\nWhen news of the Reichstag's fall spread, demoralized [GER.GetAdjective] forces began surrendering en masse, and now, with the last bastions of defiance being snuffed out like candles, more and more are surrendering.\n\nIs this the final defeat for [GER.GetNameDef]?"
 cityfall.13.a:0 "An unexpected development."
 cityfall.13.b:0 "Our victory is inevitable!"
 cityfall.13.c:0 "They might have won the battle, but they will not win the war!"
 cityfall.14.t:0 "The Fall of Berlin"
 cityfall.14.d:0 "The glorious forces of the Royal [BHU.GetAdjective] Army have recently laid waste over the strange city of Berlin and its defenders. Whatever pathetic defenses the [GER.GetAdjective]s managed to organize collapsed within hours under the assaults of the heroic [BHU.GetAdjective] stormtroopers.\n\n[GER.GetAdjective] forces surrendered man by man after the [BHU.GetAdjective] blitzed into the Reichstag, taking over the building after only half an hour of fighting, which resulted in one [BHU.GetAdjective] soldier wounded and two hundred pitiful [GER.GetAdjective] soldiers dead.\n\nThe citizens of Berlin celebrate their liberation at the hands of the heroic [BHU.GetAdjective] troops. The many statues and effigies of the old regime have begun to be torn down to clear space for sculptures worthy of being glimpsed upon by those of our glorious realm!"
 cityfall.14.a:0 "Good Lord!"
 cityfall.14.b:0 "No filthy barbarians will be able to stop our divine-led armies!"

 cityfall.15.d:0 "Surprising news today, as squadrons from the [IRE.GetAdjective] army successfully captured the [ENG.GetAdjective] capital of London after taking the better part of a day fighting. However, resistance is still fierce in much of the city, with [ENG.GetAdjective] units occupying Ealing and Islington and the [ENG.GetAdjective] Home Guard holding out with police forces in Scotland Yard.\n\nBut these are footnotes on the battle, as most of the significant landmarks have fallen to [IRE.GetAdjective] units, and fireteams of [IRE.GetAdjective] commandos are organizing to snuff out the last of the resistance."

 cityfall.16.t:0 "The Fall of London"
 cityfall.16.d:0 "Another inevitable victory on the long path of [BHU.GetAdjective] conquest happened today. The [BHU.GetAdjective] Royal Army successfully rooted out the defenders of London after they desperately failed to even put a chink in the elite legions of the Thunder Dragon.\n\nThe [ENG.GetAdjective], now living under our ever fair and glorious regime, are already starting the process of integration into our realm.\n\nThe local military commander ordered a cowardly retreat after the first [BHU.GetAdjective] soldiers entered the city. Several of his men attempted to resist the order, but their defiance proved to be in vain in the face of the superior [BHU.GetAdjective] numbers.\n\nThe people of London are already out of their houses, celebrating the entrance of their liberators!"

After numerous attempts to keep the enemy on the other side of the Potomac, [JAP.GetAdjective] troops eventually encircled the city and decimated local defenses along the Beltway. Following the fall of the two barriers, [JAP.GetAdjective] soldiers methodically took the city, building by building, razing most of the historical landmarks as they came across them.\n\nThe American experiment may have finally failed with the Washington Monument laying in ruins over the National Mall and the White House burning freely."

The [USA.GetAdjective]s fought until il Tricolore was hoisted over the White House, and when they saw the capital building, they finally gave up the fight.\n\nThe fall of Washington, D.C. is one of many landmarks marking [ITA.GetNameDef] as the emerging superpower of the world, something [ITA.GetLeader]'s speech will most likely touch upon."
