 albania.4.d:0 "The coup worked, and we now control the government headquarters. At first, Myslim Peza, the commander of our armed forces, was the favorite to become the president of Albania. However, the young Hoxha, in Paris until recently, is getting more and more popular. His eloquence is not something to underestimate. The Central Organization of the Party decided to hold an election to determine who would rule the country."
 albania.4.a:0 "Let's go with Peza!"
 albania.4.b:0 "Hoxha is better!"
 albania.5.t:0 "Hoxha's Bunkers"
 albania.5.d:0 "Today, Hoxha presented a somewhat surprising plan to communist leaders and journalists: Building bunkers all across the country. Officially, Hoxha announced building those bunkers to protect the country from external threats. He warned the people about the danger of the West. However, all of our party leaders know that those bunkers will serve as a political tool of propaganda. We can use the fear of the people to control them even better than before. About 173,000 are planned to be built."
 albania.5.a:0 "Le Hoxha të na mbrojë!"
 albania.5.b:0 "Our economy can not afford these expenses."
 albania.6.t:0 "Foreign Investors Conference"

However, investors from two particular countries cannot agree on trade in [ALB.GetNameDef]. [ITA.GetAdjective] investors are unhappy with [FRA.GetNameDef] trading with us and threaten to decrease trade with us if we don't cease trade relations with [FRA.GetNameDef]. What should we do?"

 albania.8.t:0 "Situation of [ALB.GetNameDef] in 1936"
 albania.8.d:0 "Our Kingdom is not in the best situation it could have been. The economic crisis of 1929 nearly crumbled our economy, making us dependent on [ITA.GetNameDef]. Their influence is more and more visible in our daily life as their financial investments in the country and their presence in our education and political systems are far more critical than expected. As tensions are rising in Europe, enhancing our economic situation and claiming our complete independence from [ITA.GetNameDef] should be one of our priorities. Improving relations with our neighbors such as [GRE.GetNameDef] and [YUG.GetNameDef] is also essential. Achieving these goals and expanding our army will make us a powerhouse in the Adriatic Region. Shall our great leader guide us!"

 albania.9.a:0 "Stop this demonstration and arrest the leaders!"
 albania.9.b:0 "Let them be."
 9_ALB_tt:0 "§RThere is a chance that this will cause a national uprising and a civil war!"

 albania.11.a:0 "Prepare the troops for combat!"
 albania.12.t:0 "Military Exercises with [ITA.GetNameDef]?"
 albania.12.d:0 "The government of [ITA.GetNameDef] proposed to us that we organize military exercises in Naples together. They said it could provide precious experience to our troops and improve diplomatic relations between us."

It will take some time to reverse the effects of their occupation, but it's for the greater good."
