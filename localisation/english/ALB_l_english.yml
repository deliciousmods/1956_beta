 britain.92.t:0 "[ALB.GetNameDefCap] Wishes to Join the Allies"
 britain.92.d:0 "[ALB.GetAdjective] diplomats sent a diplomatic request to join the Allies. As a democratic nation, they want to stand up with us to denounce the fascist and communist threat. Also, as the leading democratic nation, it is our role to lead others and be an example of democracy."

 albania.1.t:0 "The [ITA.GetAdjective] Affair"
 albania.1.d:0 "Our spies and diplomats dispatched to [ITA.GetNameDef] warned us that they discovered a plan made by the [ITA.GetAdjective] military high command to invade our country. The [ALB.GetAdjective] government was shocked by the news, as the [ITA.GetAdjective]s and [ALB.GetAdjective] shared friendly relations for years, on top of military and economic cooperation. Our country only has a slim chance of repelling the invasion as we are now. We need to mobilize our country and prepare our nation for war as quickly as possible!"
 albania.1.a:0 "Cursed be [ITA.GetNameDef]!"
 albania.2.t:0 "Conference of Durrës"
 albania.2.d:0 "[ITA.GetLeader] and the [ITA.GetAdjective] government agreed on negotiating a treaty in the [ALB.GetAdjective] city of Durrës. When they heard that we learned about their invasion plan they were surprised, but fortunately, they were not angry at us.\n\nThey initiated the Conference by presenting their demands:\nThey want complete control over [ALB.GetNameDef]'s foreign politics.\nThey also want the Italian language to be compulsory in [ALB.GetAdjective] schools.\n\nIn exchange, we keep complete control over our economy, while [ITA.GetNameDef] ensures our safety against external enemies. Their conditions are probably less harsh than they would be if we had let them execute their surprise invasion plan.\n\nComplete annexation would be almost our only option if their plan worked. What should we do?"
 albania.2.a:0 "Accept the conditions."
 albania.2.b:0 "Submission is out of the question, yet we can offer ourselves as a trade partner."
 albania.4.t:0 "Çeta e Pezës Chairman's Election"
 albania.4.d:0 "The coup worked, and we now control the government headquarters. At first, Myslim Peza, the commander of our armed forces, was the favorite to become the president of Albania. However, the young Hoxha, in Paris until recently, is getting more and more popular. His eloquence is not something to underestimate. The Central Organization of the Party decided to hold an election to determine who would rule the country."
 albania.4.a:0 "Let's go with Peza!"
 albania.4.b:0 "Hoxha is better!"
 albania.5.t:0 "Hoxha's Bunkers"
 albania.5.d:0 "Today, Hoxha presented a somewhat surprising plan to communist leaders and journalists: Building bunkers all across the country. Officially, Hoxha announced building those bunkers to protect the country from external threats. He warned the people about the danger of the West. However, all of our party leaders know that those bunkers will serve as a political tool of propaganda. We can use the fear of the people to control them even better than before. About 173,000 are planned to be built."
 albania.5.a:0 "Le Hoxha të na mbrojë!"
 albania.5.b:0 "Our economy can not afford these expenses."
 albania.6.t:0 "Foreign Investors Conference"
 albania.6.d:0 "The government invited investors from various countries to discuss potential investment opportunities. However, investors from two particular countries cannot agree on trade in [ALB.GetNameDef]. [ITA.GetAdjective] investors are unhappy with [FRA.GetNameDef] trading with us and threaten to decrease trade with us if we don't cease trade relations with [FRA.GetNameDef]. What should we do?"
 albania.6.a:0 "It would be better to align ourselves with [ITA.GetNameDef]."
 albania.6.b:0 "Cursed be [ITA.GetNameDef]! We're going with [FRA.GetNameDef]!"
 albania.7.t:0 "Treaty of Milan"
 albania.7.d:0 "Following negotiations, the [ALB.GetAdjective] government and [ITA.GetLeader] decided to sign a final treaty. We were able to escape the war with [ITA.GetNameDef] by diplomatic means. The nation's people are also grateful to us for not sending them to their deaths. We can be proud of ourselves!\n\nNote: [ITA.GetNameDefCap] will no longer attack [ALB.GetNameDef] through the focus tree. The focus "Albanian Occupation" is now disabled."
 albania.7.a:0 "Great!"
 albania.8.t:0 "Situation of [ALB.GetNameDef] in 1936"
 albania.8.d:0 "Our Kingdom is not in the best situation it could have been. The economic crisis of 1929 nearly crumbled our economy, making us dependent on [ITA.GetNameDef]. Their influence is more and more visible in our daily life as their financial investments in the country and their presence in our education and political systems are far more critical than expected. As tensions are rising in Europe, enhancing our economic situation and claiming our complete independence from [ITA.GetNameDef] should be one of our priorities. Improving relations with our neighbors such as [GRE.GetNameDef] and [YUG.GetNameDef] is also essential. Achieving these goals and expanding our army will make us a powerhouse in the Adriatic Region. Shall our great leader guide us!"
 albania.8.a:0 "Onwards!"
 albania.9.t:0 "The Hunger Strike of February 1936"
 albania.9.d:0 "Workers and artisans in Korçë arose and began a major strike in the city. They denounce the economic situation of the country and the poverty they are in. If we let them continue their demonstration, this movement could spread in the country and cause a general revolt. But repressing the strike could affect our public image and relations with other countries."
 albania.9.a:0 "Stop this demonstration and arrest the leaders!"
 albania.9.b:0 "Let them be."
 albania.11.t:0 "Revolt in the North!"
 albania.11.d:0 "The workers in the North rose and armed themselves, defeated the local garrison, and took control of the northern part of the country! With Myslim Peza as their chief, our situation is grave. We shouldn't have let them be."
 albania.11.a:0 "Prepare the troops for combat!"
 albania.12.t:0 "Military Exercises with [ITA.GetNameDef]?"
 albania.12.d:0 "The government of [ITA.GetNameDef] proposed to us that we organize military exercises in Naples together. They said it could provide precious experience to our troops and improve diplomatic relations between us."
 albania.12.a:0 "We will accept."
 albania.12.b:0 "Decline the proposition."
 albania.13.t:0 "[ALB.GetNameDefCap] Wishes to Join the Comintern"
 albania.13.d:0 "Our comrades in the Party of Labour of Albania have made significant progress. [ALB.GetNameDefCap] is ready to join the Comintern."
 albania.13.a:0 "Let our comrades join us!"
 albania.13.b:0 "They are not ready yet."
 albania.14.t:0 "[ALB.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Guarantee"
 albania.14.d:0 "The [ALB.GetAdjective] government, anxious to maintain its independence in these troubled times, wishes to deepen relations between our two nations by establishing a defensive treaty that would ensure that [ALB.GetNameDef]'s borders are maintained."
 albania.14.a:0 "[ALB.GetNameDefCap] has our protection."
 albania.14.b:0 "We have no interests in defending [ALB.GetNameDef]."
