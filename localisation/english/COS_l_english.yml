 costa_rica.1.d:0 "Democracy is worth preserving.\n\nEven though many close allies of President Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno advised him to disregard the constitution and run again, he took a stand. He refused to jeopardize the fragile political system of his country, knowing that the blatant disregard for democratic values would forever taint even a convincing victory. As such, León Cortés Castro decided to take up the mantle himself and run for the National Republican Party - and after a long and arduous campaign, he finally won the election with an absolute majority.\n\nThe whole election was a historical oddity with quite a few very unusual events, such as the near-collapse of the National Party and the rise of the Workers and Farmers Party. However, the establishment of [COS.GetNameDef] is just too stable to be shaken up by a single election.\n\nCastro will be the next leader of [COS.GetNameDef], and many are already wondering if he can fill the big shoes of Oreamuno. His presidency will determine if the rise of the Workers and Farmers Party will be a mere footnote in history or the beginning of something much bigger."

 costa_rica.2.t:0 "Calderón Elected"
 costa_rica.2.d:0 "A few weeks ago, the potential campaign of Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno had been a hot topic among the politically active citizens of [COS.GetNameDef]. It was virtually ensured that he would win another term if he decided to run again, but it turned out that he had chosen to retire from politics for good instead. Oreamuno isn't a young man anymore. Spending his remaining few golden years with his wife and grandchildren was more appealing than taking another dive into the sewage tank known as national politics.\n\nFortunately, the fate of [COS.GetNameDef] does not rest on the shoulders of a single man. The political machine kept on chugging after his departure, and the National Republican Party quickly settled on a new candidate instead. Rafael Ángel Calderón emerged as the party's new leader, and the results of the recent election indicate that he deserves his position. In a blowout victory, Calderón won the election with more than 80% of the vote.\n\nEven though Calderón had luck on his side - before the election, the Communist-Guanacasteca alliance fell apart, and the National Party disbanded - it is still quite evident that he is a political genius. In the next four years, he'll have to prove that he's more than a single-minded prodigy, as he will be representing the country on an international stage. Winning an election and being an effective leader requires widely different skill sets, and Calderón is set to demonstrate that he possesses both."
