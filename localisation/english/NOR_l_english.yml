 NOR_mountaineers:0 "Mountaineers"
 NOR_mountaineers_desc:0 "Although our country has many people talented in traversing the mountains, adding military specialisation on top of this will allow some to truly excel at mountain operations.

 NOR_armored_battalions_desc:0 "To break the stalemate of the Great War, Britain and France developed great armored war machines, impervious to most of the devastating machine gun fire of the western front. Now, new tactics, engines, frames and guns have made these armored vehicles more powerful than ever, and so we should try to catch up to the major powers in this regard, even at the cost of large fuel expenses."

 NOR_tungtvann_desc:0 "While Norsk Hydro's industrial facilities and research labs at Vemork and Rjukan already provide us with power and useful chemicals, the surplus heavy water they produce should also help us advance in hitherto unexplored fields of science.

The company was initially established to make use of the Birkeland-Eyde process, which utilized electrical arcs for the production of nitrate components (for making fertilizers.) The Birkeland-Eyde process was very energy intensive (which not few of Hydro's later industrial ventures would also turn out to be), and thus required cheap power. Luckily, Norwegian Hydroelectric power was getting abundant by then. Nevertheless this meant the process did not do too well elsewhere in the world, and eventually the company switched to less energy intensive methods. In 1927 the switch was made to the Haber-Bosch process in cooperation with the chemical giant IG Farben.\n\nNorsk Hydro's facilities in Rjukan and Notodden now produced liquid ammonia, which was then transported to their new facilities at Herøya for production of Calcium Nitrate, which thus became known as Norwegian saltpeter. Now Norsk Hydro is expanding into new fields; in 1934 the world's first commercial heavy water facility was built at Vemork, producing industrial quantities of this new commodity.\n"

The innovative and efficient production methods allowed the local foundry to become a large and respected factory in a matter of less than three decades.\n\nWith expanded markets, the Oslo-based factory eventually began producing tools and other iron-based goods as well.

In Norway, however, he holds no such formal titles, as aristocracy was discontinued with the Nobility Law of 1821.

Now he has already made his mark on Norwegian politics, being one of the people behind the so-called \"crisis accord\" with the Farmers' Party, which allowed him to form a Government in 1935, as was asked of him.

He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1916, and was noted as a moderate and sober politician, representing the interests of practical businesses.\n\nHis acceptance of social liberal reforms, as well as his pleasant and humble demeanor, earned him much trust throughout the years. He turned down his first opportunity to become Prime Minister, but in 1926 his namesake Government formed, and this time with him as the Prime Minister of Norway. After this he has continued his work in politics, an example being the naming dispute of his home city, Trondhjem.

Shortly thereafter he got into the city council of Bergen, and he was the mayor during the dissolution of the Union between Norway and Sweden. In 1907 he took office in the Norwegian Parliament for the first time.\n\nSince then Johan L. Mowinckel would later go on to be part of several Governments, serving as Prime Minister thrice, and often holding other important positions such as President of the Storting (the Norwegian Parliament), Minister of Industry, Minister of Commerce, and Foreign Minister, among other positions.

He got married to the British Princess Maud (whom the Norwegian Antarctic territories are named after) in Buckingham Palace in 1896. Since then Carl (the name he mostly used) and Maud travelled between Denmark and Great Britain.\n\nThe lifestyle of the couple would change drastically when Norwegian politicians approached Prince Carl with an offer to become the King of independent Norway as the Union between Norway and Sweden dissolved. The 18th of November 1905, Prince Carl announced through telegram that he would take the name Haakon VII, and that his son and heir (Alexander) would be given the name Olav. The 25th of November he arrived in Norway, and the 27th he took the Oath as Norway's first independent King in 518 years.\n\nNow through some unprecedented further changes towards the traditional, the democratically minded Haakon finds himself as a more absolute and traditional King than ever before.

During the Great War he detested the peace sentiment, but moderated his views after noting the enormous human costs of the war.\n\nSince then he served as an attaché, he served as the military's expert on Russian affairs, he helped Fridtjof Nansen organize humanitarian relief efforts following the Great War, he got married twice, he flirted with the Norwegian communist movement (no doubt inspired by the effective People's Militias of the Soviet Union), he served as the Defense Minister in Peder Kolstad's Agrarian Government (despite being neither an agrarian nor Kolstad's friend, but his experience and knowledge were undeniable), and finally he helped form the political party \"Nasjonal Samling\" out of the former political movement \"Nordisk folkereisning i Norge\".

In 1900 his political career brought him into the Norwegian Parliament for the first time as a representative of the Liberal Party, Venstre. In 1905 he switched his political allegiance to the Labour Party, where he turned down another period in the Parliament in 1912 in favour of continued work for the Norwegian postal service.\n\nWhile holding experience both with regular jobs and politics, Egede-Nissen was no stranger to more radical approaches to getting things done either, having illegally smuggled and printed revolutionary literature, as well as formed a radical Miner's Union in 1906. His time in Vardø gave him insight into the growing revolutionary sentiment in Russia, which he's since supported to quite a large degree. He was the mayor of Stavanger from 1915 to 1919, during which he was fined for his involvement in the 1919 general strike in support of the Russian revolution. In 1918 he had also went to Russia and met with Lenin, while also attending a meeting dedicated to the formation of the now well known Comintern. When the Labour Party split in 1923, Egede-Nissen followed the more radical politicians and joined the Norwegian Communist Party, NKP."

While the demands are quite extensive, the North Atlantic Islands are not the most economically important area of our country, and a return of Slesvig would have proven much more profitable. Should we accept or reject this proposal, or mayhaps propose a compromise, seeing the demands are quite extensive?"
 naw_norway.50.a:0 "Accept, and throw in Greenland as well. We should befriend our kindred people in the North at any cost!"

While this is a significant setback for our diplomatic path to increased influence, we play this the risky way and instigate revolts on Iceland and the Faroes, seeing as the inhabitants were originally from the Norwegian mainland and part of our Kingdom.

Greenland remains safe as the inhabitants there do not have such extensive ties to Norway, but we need to take a stance here.

 naw_norway.55.d:0 "The revolt instigations have been a total success. The Danes have folded to salvage the initial deal, not wanting to risk war, and seeing as the supply lines to Greenland were to long to be worth maintaining. Since the initial deal was pretty largely in our favour, we should forgive their transgressions and support their right to Slesvig if it's ever a relevant issue."

 naw_norway.70.d:0 "The Old Traditions of [ROOT.GetNameDef] has recently seen a romantic revival, with people and politicians now questioning whether old traditions such as aristocratic titles should be brought back (though with our democratic traditions, most agree the titles should come without the privileges this time.) Some even argue for bringing back old place names and even the old flag of the medieval Kingdom of Norway. Which course of action should we take?"
 naw_norway.70.a:0 "Aristocracy is outdated, and we should of course stick to our current Norwegian flag."
 naw_norway.70.b:0 "Aristocratic titles for our most upstanding citizens, but keep our current flag."
 naw_norway.70.c:0 "We must respect our traditions! We shall have aristocracy AND our glorious old flag."
 
 naw_norway.71.t:0 "The Location of Power"
 naw_norway.71.d:0 "In the past [ROOT.GetNameDef] has had many different capitals, but the main three remain Oslo, Bergen (formerly known as Bjørgvin) and Trondheim (formerly known as Nidaros.) With the rapid changes towards our traditional Kingdom, we now also have a chance to make one of the older cities the capital again, should we so wish. Though, Oslo is still the biggest city, close to most of our agriculture and containing most of our institutions, so the move might not prove popular around there..."
 naw_norway.71.a:0 "Stick with Oslo as capital."
 naw_norway.71.b:0 "Go with Bergen, former capital and an important trading city."
 naw_norway.71.c:0 "Go with Trondheim, former capital and an important spot for pilgrims and religion."
 
 naw_norway.72.t:0 "City names of Old?"
 naw_norway.72.d:0 "With key symbolic issues decided upon, it might be time to consider if we should reinstate old placenames, specifically for our cities. Should we stick with what the current generations know, rename our biggest cities, or even start with renaming all the big cities and several of the smaller ones to really bring about some change?"
 naw_norway.72.a:0 "Leave it. The most important thing is that there's no Christiania."
 naw_norway.72.b:0 "Rename the major cities. Bjørgvin and Nidaros shall be brought back."
 naw_norway.72.c:0 "Major rebranding is needed. Start with Bergen, Trondheim, Aalesund and Hamar."
 
 naw_norway.73.t:0 "The Monarchist Coalition"
 naw_norway.73.d:0 "Now that the Monarchist Coalition is in power, who should lead it in its initial steps to shape our Kingdom? Our oldest political party, the Liberal Party? Our pro-tradition Agrarian Party? Or maybe the Conservatives?"
 naw_norway.73.a:0 "The Liberal Party."
 naw_norway.73.b:0 "The Farmers' Party."
 naw_norway.73.c:0 "The Conservative Party."
 
 naw_norway.74.t:0 "The Extent of Power"
 naw_norway.74.d:0 "With the revival of old traditions, politicians and supporters of the new, yet old, state has questioned just how it's supposed to be run. With the Prime Minister answering to the King for all intents, or still retaining many Parliamentary powers? How often should elections be held? How much power should the King have in this reshaped Kingdom, specifically?"
 naw_norway.74.a:0 "Elections as usual, and a traditional, yet Constitutional Monarchy."
 naw_norway.74.b:0 "More power to the King. Still, a Constitutional Monarchy with elections."
 naw_norway.74.c:0 "The Prime Minister should answer to the King, but elections should still be held."
 naw_norway.74.p:0 "The King shall have widespread power, a true traditional Monarchy."
 
 naw_norway.75.t:0 "Traditions worth fighting for?"
 naw_norway.75.d:0 "With the wave of Monarchism washing over our country, many people have flocked to our Monarchist ranks. Should we seize the moment with force, or should we wait for people to come around to our wholesome point of view?"
 naw_norway.75.a:0 "We fight at dawn!"
 naw_norway.75.b:0 "Eh, maybe at dawn in say, a month. We need to prepare."
 naw_norway.75.c:0 "The King wouldn't like it if we started a war for his sake. We'll convince them in time."
 
 naw_norway.76.t:0 "Prepared to fight?"
 naw_norway.76.d:0 "It's been a month since our Monarchist supporters first met. Is this the moment to strike, risking a civil war?"
 naw_norway.76.a:0 "We're ready. To war!"
 naw_norway.76.b:0 "Maybe this wasn't such a good idea in the end.."
 
 naw_norway.77.t:0 "Norway invites us to their Alliance"
 naw_norway.77.d:0 "In the national anthem of Norway, sixth verse, there's a part about how the Scandinavians shall stand together in wars. The Norwegians are now reviving the Pan-Scandinavianism (or Pan-Nordic) movement, and they are reaching out to us."

 naw_norway.80.t:0 "The Faroe Islands Reintegrated"
 naw_norway.80.d:0 "Having rekindled our connection to our kinsmen on the Faroes, they now feel welcome and strive to integrate into their past nation of origin. [Root.GetName] welcomes them home. Now, how shall we name the islands now within our country?"
 naw_norway.80.a:0 "With bokmål, the written language of the majority."
 naw_norway.80.b:0 "With nynorsk, the current written language closest to spoken dialects and old Norwegian."
 naw_norway.80.c:0 "Let's use the language of the native Faroese people to name their islands."
 
 naw_norway.81.t:0 "Iceland Reintegrated"
 naw_norway.81.d:0 "Fate has once again brought us together with the Isle of Viking Sagas. Originally Norwegians fleeing the rule and taxes of our first King, and later brought back into the Norwegian Kingdom, the Danish Union and treaty of Kiel once took Iceland away from us along with the Faroes and Greenland. Our similar culture, history and ancestry now bring us together once more."
 naw_norway.81.a:0 "Another event worthy of a Saga."
 
 naw_norway.82.t:0 "Greenland Reintegrated"
 naw_norway.82.d:0 "While the original Norwegian-Icelandic settlers on Greenland died out, Greenland was brought back into the Norwegian fold by a Dano-Norwegian mission which reached the island in the 1720s. The treaty of Kiel took this island away from us, with us having little say in the matter. And the Greenland case did not work out well for us either... Now, however, fate has brought it back to us. While the new settlers of this island, the Inuit people, have been Christened and integrated, they're not originally of Norwegian ancestry like the Faroese and Icelandic peoples, so integration has naturally been harder here. But now, finally, the Inuit are starting to settle into their new nation."
 naw_norway.82.a:0 "The Greenlanders will do well in our nation."
 
 naw_norway.83.t:0 "Jamtland Reintegrated"
 naw_norway.83.d:0 "The rough, yet beautiful landscapes of Jamtland, as well as its inhabitants, have been reintegrated into the Norwegian nation. There is however, the question on what we name this new addition to our country, or rather, how we name it. Should we use modern Norwegian written language, or something based on our other less common written language, but which is more traditional, and conforms to both the dialects of the Jamtlanders themselves and our bordering region of Trøndelag? There's also the back to our roots approach where we give it its old norse name."
 naw_norway.83.a:0 "Let's go with the written language of the majority, the bokmål variant."
 naw_norway.83.b:0 "Let's stick with traditions and local dialects, the nynorsk variant."
 naw_norway.83.c:0 "Let's go back to our common roots, the Norse variant."
 
 naw_norway.84.t:0 "Båhuslen Reintegrated"
 naw_norway.84.d:0 "Båhuslen was Norwegian land for 800 years before it was lost in one of the many wars between the Danes and Swedes, with us involved due to our union with Denmark. And while it was briefly recaptured, it didn't make the peace treaties. Now though, events have brought it into our ownership once more, and the people of Båhuslen are ready to contribute to their new nation, no doubt our long history and our common heritage helping."
 naw_norway.84.a:0 "Our numbers grow, as does our coastline."
 naw_norway.84.b:0 "Our very old, Norwegian coastline."
 naw_norway.84.c:0 "Very, very old, in fact..."
 
 naw_norway.85.t:0 "Shetland Reintegrated"
 naw_norway.85.d:0 "The Shetland islands were once part of the Norwegian Jarldom of Orkney, one of the highest ranking titles one could hold within the Norwegian Kingdom. As they have recently come under our ownership again, we've worked on reintegrating these former Norwegian islands into our country again, and now we've seen success. But the question remains; Shetland, or Hjaltland?"
 naw_norway.85.a:0 "Shetland is a nice modern take on the old..."
 naw_norway.85.b:0 "But you can't beat the original, Hjaltland it is!"
 
 naw_norway.86.t:0 "Orkney Reintegrated"
 naw_norway.86.d:0 "The Orkney islands were once the centerpiece of the Jarldom of Orkney, one of the highest ranking titles one could hold within the Norwegian Kingdom. Now they have surprisingly come under our ownership again. With a mixed heritage of Norwegian, Celtic and Scots, the people of the area have now been integrated into our nation, and they are willing to become citizens. But how shall we name the area now? In a modern way, a traditional way, or a very traditional way?"
 naw_norway.86.a:0 "Modern bokmål will do nicely. With the samnorsk initiatives, it's Norwegian enough."
 naw_norway.86.b:0 "Nynorsk of course! Language based on how Norwegians speak, not how Danes write."
 naw_norway.86.c:0 "Let's start things where we left it, with inhabitants speaking the Norse language."
 
 naw_norway.100.t:0 "The Moscow Trials"
 naw_norway.100.d:0 "The Soviet Union has, and still is, going through some large and brutal internal changes. Many people of power and influence have been sentenced during the already infamous Moscow Trials.\n\nWith international press being allowed to attend, what has been noted is that surprising amounts of the people on trial have admitted to very serious crimes within the Union. Could they have been forced or pressured into admitting this? Is the General Secretary attempting to get rid of political opponents?\n\nAs news are brought back to Norway, media and people have speculated on what is going on, and often condemned the trials as unjust and suspect. Many of our political parties are now distancing themselves from the Comintern, and have moderated themselves. How shall we handle these reports from Moscow?"
 naw_norway.100.a:0 "Condemn unjust trials and let our media freely report and inform."
 naw_norway.100.b:0 "Attempt to cover up the worst parts, the workers need socialism."
 naw_norway.100.c:0 "Let's use this farce to promote nationalist and anti-communist sentiments."

 naw_norway.140.d:0 "In this age of rapidly shifting political situations, Norway has decided to go a rather different route than countries such as the Soviet Union, Italy and Germany, with their new and unprecedented political ideologies. Indeed in the Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy of Norway many people have argued for a return to traditions, old values and an old fashioned Kingdom. Though this time without rule from Copenhagen or Stockholm.\n\nThe traditional conservative, centrist, agrarian and monarchist elements have now joined forces with much of the Military to attempt to restore such a state. In the capital area, this move has met massive resistance, and volunteers have started pouring in from Europe. The Norwegian Civil War has now undeniably started."

How shall we deal with these perpetrators?"

While serving as monarch and Head of State has many responsibilities already, some can be delegated to other royal family members, as well as connected statesmen. This will free up our monarch for one additional role, which could inspire our military and citizens in any conflicts they may be dragged into.\n\nWhile theoretically the country's highest commander, direct command of forces is in practice left to the highest ranking career officers of the military's branches. An advisor role would be the safest choice, but serving as an Army Commander of the highest rank could inspire our troops, though Haakon himself is wary of this since it's not his area of expertise. Another option could be to let the King serve as a Naval Commander, as he has been formally educated as well as served as a Naval Officer before.\nSo, should we shift the King's responsibilities toward supporting the military, or continue as before?"

While both sides were then content with a neutral Scandinavia (trading pressures on Norway and Denmark by the Entente and Central Powers respectively notwithstanding), there is hope that once again any European Powers involved in major conflicts will come to the same conclusion, but if not, a strong military in the form of a Neutrality Guard up to date for [GetYear] may be the deterrence needed to keep would-be attackers peaceful still.\n\nA Neutrality Guard for a country overseas from any major powers would be twofold, Naval Deterrence in the form of patrol boats, and on land, a trained and well equipped military ready to defend the country."

Sweden, Denmark and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom, all hold their \"fair\" share of these former islands, titles, landscapes and border regions. Yet, there is still no need to give up hope...\n\nShould we get a hold of any of these territories again, the modern Norwegian state is now in a good position to reintegrate them, with a solid economy and plenty of skilled statesmen.

Under our rule they will be an autonomous duchy promoting Norse-Gaelic ties as a means to align the populace to us.\n\nWhile this would take effort and resources, it might very well be worth it for us to rule the area indirectly, through local lords, land owners and politicians."

 NOR_electrification_of_western_norways_railroads_desc:0 "Western Norway has great landscapes for generating hydroelectric power, so utilizing this further through the electrification of the main railroads going through the region could prove to be a most sensible investment."
 NOR_electrify_border_region_jamtland:0 "Electrify Border Region Jamtland"
 NOR_electrify_border_region_jamtland_desc:0 "The Swedes were pretty much pioneers in the electrification of their railroads, due in fact to them having significant potential for hydroelectric power generation like us. While the Kiruna-Stockholm connection was prioritized and has largely been a success, now that we too have undertaken massive projects in and around our centers of population and production, sparing some resources for our border regions is possible. The local Jamtlanders may appreciate such a move significantly, and anyone passing through can do so more efficiently."

 NOR_electrify_border_region_vaestergoetland_desc:0 "The Swedes were pretty much pioneers in the electrification of their railroads, due in fact to them having significant potential for hydroelectric power generation like us. While the Kiruna-Stockholm connection was prioritized and has largely been a success, now that we too have undertaken massive projects in and around our centers of population and production, sparing some resources for our border regions is possible. Västergötland, one of the traditional regions of Sweden, is one such region. If we did this with the Swedes in control of the region they'd be sure to appreciate it, in addition to making movement more efficient for anyone who pass through the area."
 NOR_extend_nordlandsbanen_to_narvik:0 "Extend Nordlandsbanen to Narvik"
 NOR_extend_nordlandsbanen_to_narvik_desc:0 "Now reaching Bodø, extending Nordlandsbanen to the important ice-free port of Narvik would allow resources and manpower to move to and from Narvik and most of Norway without relying on shipping. Though much of the Swedish iron ore is shipped internationally from there, a connection would still be beneficial, even if the politics around railroad extensions further North are a bit strained for the time being."
 NOR_extend_nordlandsbanen_to_tromsoe:0 "Extend Nordlandsbanen to Tromsø"
 NOR_extend_nordlandsbanen_to_tromsoe_desc:0 "Another extension to the Lyngen-area and Tromsø would well and truly have connected the population and economic hubs of Northern Norway to the rest of the country. Though the terrain is harsh and the politics of how far the railroad should go is equally harsh, somewhere around Tromsø seems a decent maximum for now."
 NOR_extend_raumabanen_to_molde_and_aalesund:0 "Extend Raumabanen to Molde and Aalesund"
 NOR_extend_raumabanen_to_molde_and_aalesund_desc:0 "Now reaching Aandalsnes in the inner Romsdal area, further extensions toward either Kristiansund, Molde and/or Aalesund seem to have been halted, in part due to the coastal locations fighting over where the railroad extension should go, each favoring themselves. A political deadlock, cutting through the politics and disagreements to get it extended to the large populations along the coast anyways may be desirable. Surely this will be done eventually. Right?"
 NOR_finalize_the_conversion_of_roerosbanen_to_standard-gauge:0 "Finalize the Conversion of Rørosbanen to Standard-gauge"
 NOR_finalize_the_conversion_of_roerosbanen_to_standard-gauge_desc:0 "One of Norway's earliest railways, built to past specifications when narrower railway-gauges were common, Rørosbanen is currently being converted to today's standard-gauge railways in several stages. Finalizing this should allow higher speeds and more effective use of the old railroad."
 NOR_invest_in_the_cross-iceland_railroad:0 "Invest in the Cross-Iceland Railroad"
 NOR_invest_in_the_cross-iceland_railroad_desc:0 "A railroad across Iceland has been a purely theoretical thing up until recently, but with the continuous development of our railroads, some people now champion investing some of our surplus industry, materials and money towards making a railroad across Iceland, utilizing their hydroelectric power to run it from the start. Investing so significantly in them should also see trade and investment relations between the Icelanders and us grow stronger."
 NOR_prepare_bergensbanen_for_military_use:0 "Prepare Bergensbanen for military use"
 NOR_prepare_bergensbanen_for_military_use_desc:0 "Connecting the capital, administrative center and largest city of Oslo to the trading hub and second largest city of Bergen has of course been of great importance to politicians, the general populace and businesses alike ever since longer railways became feasible. Crossing through hills, elevated plateaus and mountains, the railroad has paid off its cost even if initially a steep investment. Already useable by our military in a pinch, upgrading it further may be a sound idea on account of its importance."

 NOR_prepare_dovrebanen_for_military_use_desc:0 "Dovrebanen is a long railway crossing most of Eastern Norway and connecting it to the important center of Norway, with several smaller tracks connecting to this main track as well. Upgrading it further to allow movement through Norway's largest swaths of agricultural lands seems very prudent, and the connection to Trondheim, while important on its own merit, could later be the start of connecting Northern Norway to the rest of the country."
 NOR_prepare_raumabanen_for_military_use:0 "Prepare Raumabanen for military use"
 NOR_prepare_raumabanen_for_military_use_desc:0 "While somewhat short and nothing too special when observed only on a map, Raumabanen crosses the elevated and at times Alpine landscapes of Oppland and Sunnmøre, connecting the East to the West. Allowing rapid movement for troops here could mean the difference between fighting on or death and capture for any friendly troops deployed in the area."
 NOR_prepare_soerlandsbanen_for_military_use:0 "Prepare Sørlandsbanen for military use"
 NOR_prepare_soerlandsbanen_for_military_use_desc:0 "Sørlandsbanen has provided great benefits to our economy by connecting the productive maritime city of Stavanger on Norway's Western coast with the gentle landscapes of Southern Norway, and Southern Norway with the administrative and financial center of Oslo. Allowing troops access to quick movements from West to South onwards to East could be of great importance."
 ##specific technology sharing decisions
 NOR_nordic_research:0 "Nordic Research Invitations"
 NOR_invite_country_into_nordic_research:0 "Invite [From.GetName] into the Nordic Research Group"
 NOR_invite_country_into_nordic_research_desc:0 "A measure both practical and solidaric, the §YNordic Research Collaboration§! could be expanded by inviting more countries in our sphere into the core group of countries currently cooperating scientifically."
 ##prestigious projects
 NOR_fund_the_royal_norwegian_society:0 "Fund the Royal Norwegian Society"
 NOR_fund_the_royal_norwegian_society_desc:0 "Founded in 1760, \"Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskab\" is the oldest scientific and scholarly institution in Norway, where the country's finest minds within sciences and related fields get voted in, furthermore awarding prizes to great discoveries and advancements made by Norwegians.\n\nNow, by funding and expanding the society with larger premises, cooperation with our other learning institutions as well as having our statesmen and diplomats invite foreign academics within our sphere, we can share methods and knowledge with our friends, as well as organize joint research efforts into the most promising topics of the day. While this will no doubt bring more knowledge and prestige to us in the long run, expanding an elite institution to include far more members is bound to be met with some initial resistance, though."
 NOR_fund_additional_scientific_equipment:0 "Fund Additional Scientific Equipment"
 NOR_fund_additional_scientific_equipment_desc:0 "By funding additional scientific testing equipment, the members of the §YRoyal Norwegian Society§! can attempt to reproduce some of the promising research they observe within their fields, thus being able to ensure the validity of the science they observe. This could make our research collaboration even more efficient."
 NOR_invite_foreign_academics_to_the_royal_norwegian_society:0 "Invite Foreign Academics to the Royal Norwegian Society"
 NOR_invite_foreign_academics_to_the_royal_norwegian_society_desc:0 "Now that the Royal Norwegian Society has been expanded and foreign academics are here, inviting the academics of newly joined alliance members would be a trivial matter, should we wish to share our knowledge and enlightened cooperation further."
 ##foreign politics
 NOR_share_military_tactics_with_iceland:0 "Share Military Tactics with Iceland"
 NOR_share_military_tactics_with_iceland_desc:0 "With §YIceland§! in our alliance, it would seem prudent to share some of our general military know-how with them in such a serious situation, which maybe even could be of life and death. A cooperation here only makes sense given our geographic proximity and largely shared history."
 NOR_share_specialized_tactics_with_iceland:0 "Share Specialized Tactics with Iceland"
 NOR_share_specialized_tactics_with_iceland_desc:0 "With §YIceland§! now more than an alliance member, rather an autonomous part of our country in practice, we can share some of our more specialized knowledge with them, such as our mountain tactics and our winter warfare experience. If we also integrate Norwegian Advisors with the Icelandic Security Forces they would benefit with better being able to protect themselves, and we can trust the North Atlantic to be a defended area."
 ##political actions
 NOR_the_kings_choice:0 "The King's Choice"
 NOR_the_kings_choice_desc:0 "An emotion laden King has received our enemy's demand for our surrender and appointment of a collaborationist Government. The King wept as he told the Government and Parliament he'd abdicate if they agreed to such demands. Let us therefore give our enemies the King's \"No\", and let our Government endorse his stance to fight for our independence."
 NOR_expand_the_kings_responsibilities:0 "Expand the King's Responsibilities"
 NOR_expand_the_kings_responsibilities_desc:0 "While a monarch can have many responsibilities even in Kingdoms with the most symbolic of monarchs, shifting some of these responsibilities to other members of the royal family or connected statesmen to free up time for more important tasks may be desirable. In our case, in our monarchist country the King could be used to advise the military, or inspire our troops and citizens during conflicts."
 NOR_rebrand_into_the_modern_kingdom:0 "Rebrand into the Modern Kingdom"
 NOR_rebrand_into_the_modern_kingdom_desc:0 "Should we so wish, we could once again take on the modern flag and appearance to the world. This would take a lot of effort from our statesmen though, and rebranding can not be done often."
 NOR_rebrand_into_the_traditional_kingdom:0 "Rebrand into the Traditional Kingdom"
 NOR_rebrand_into_the_traditional_kingdom_desc:0 "Should we so wish we could take on the traditional flag and appearance of the Norwegian Kingdom of Old. While doing this in a sudden manner could be expensive on our administrative resources, and is not a decision one could reverse quickly, it can still be done if we so wish."
 NOR_expand_the_duchy_of_icelands_administrative_duties:0 "Expand the Duchy of Iceland's Administrative Duties"
 NOR_expand_the_duchy_of_icelands_administrative_duties_desc:0 "Already administering an expanded realm, it could be sensible to let our autonomous Duchy of Iceland administer Greenland, the large island in their vicinity, of which they have familiarity historically. This should free us up to focus on other theaters, and could even improve the long term development of Greenland."

 #NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Stable politically since its independence, Norway has been hit by the great depression and worries as clouds gather over Europe. Nevertheless the pacifist policies are still in place despite the warnings of the military. In the meantime the economic crisis has made the lower classes more militant, pushed by the small communist party while small groups of nationalists are willing to radically transform society.\n\n"
