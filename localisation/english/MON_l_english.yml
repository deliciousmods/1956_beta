As the People's Revolution of 1924 commenced, the young proletarian got appointed as a chairman of Baga Khural which opened him a way to the highest echelons of power. \n\nSupport of the Soviet officials allowed him to become one of the three state secretaries after the Seventh Party Congress of 1928. The council started to implement harsh collectivization and anti-buddhist policies resulting into open rebellions around the country. His survival of the counterpurge was linked with high loyalty to the cause and direct supervision of Iosif Stalin back in the 1932. \n\nThis relationship, however, didn't last long, as the pro-religious stance of ill-mannered Genden made him appear as an "unreliable ally" by various Soviet officials at the dawn of 1935..."

mongol.20.d:0 "The dispatched squadron has effectively penetrated the enemy defensive perimeter and facing little to no opposition, has managed to infiltrate the local village disguised as a local militia,  seize some of the ill-guarded weapons from local storages, load those on horses and disappear in the dark without raising any alarm or harming civilians in the area. \n\nHeading back to the base, our soldiers have reported of some weapons variations which can be used to improve our own designs - a very welcome addition to use for the next raid."
mongol.20.a:0 "Bring in the trophies and study them!"

mongol.21.t:0 "Small Raid Failed"
mongol.21.d:0 "The offensive party has moved out as planned and meeting no resistance, has successfully crossed the disputed border, aiming to reach the local settlement before the sunrise, when suddenly our forces were ambushed by an unknown striking force. A well-executed trap seems to be prepared in advance, as if every step of our forces was anticipated. \n\nOur troops managed to establish a safe passage and rapidly retreat into our homelands. Some are wounded while many have lost their weapons, and even more of them feeling demoralized by the seemingly superior enemy."
mongol.21.a:0 "Our soldiers morale is broken..."

mongol.22.t:0 "Offensive Halted"
mongol.22.d:0 "A movement of some sort was spotted on the horizon as our raiding party has advanced into the enemy lands. A few hours later our brigade was met with an advancing enemy party with short exchange turned into the heated battle after some shots were fired by impatient soldiers on both sides. \n\nThe fire exchange lasted for a few hours with both parties retreating to their headquarters to reorganize, regain strength and refill the ammunition. The objective of the operation was unfortunately not met, yet some executed tactics and maneuvers allowed us to gain a valuable experience out of it."
mongol.22.a:0 "Very well. Our troops have learned a valuable lesson."

mongol.23.t:0 "Small Raid Repelled"
mongol.23.d:0 "Rapid mobilization of our reserves and fast dispatch of the forces has prevented a potential disaster from happening. \nAs advancing [MON.getAdjective] troops moved deeper into our territory, vigilant border regiments followed them and observed the situation from afar while regular troops prepared a battleground for those unsuspecting bandits. \n\nRight before the planned main engagement could began, one of our impulsive commanders has ordered the troops to engage the enemy, leaving other parties to follow the rapid advance and thus allowing the raiders to escape the probably encirclement and disappear in the dark, leaving however many guns behind which we can use to our advantage."
mongol.23.a:0 "A victory for our people!"

mongol.24.t:0 "Small [MON.GetAdjective] Party Raided Our Borders"
mongol.24.d:0 "Earlier this day a border patrol party has discovered traces of an apparent enemy squadron which crossed our border not later than a few days ago. Footprints and horseshoe traces suggest that the hostile team consisted of a few dozen light-armed man accompanied by a cavalry regiment, followed the road leading to the local ammunition storage, successfully pacified unsuspecting guards and left the following night, taking most of the present ammunition from the facility. \n\nThe rumour of "Ghost Riders" has already begin to spread among the local population. A small police garrison is to be dispatched into the contested area to oversight the region protection for the next few weeks."
mongol.24.a:0 "We have lost few valuable men and assets!"

mongol.25.t:0 "Stalemate Achieved"
mongol.25.d:0 "An enemy raiding party was spotted by a few observable peasants who immediately delivered the worrying message to the captain of the local police squadron who dispatched a "meeting delegation" to the contested area, aiming to slow down the advance of the enemy. \n\nFollowing the short round of negotiations, both parties opened fire claiming to be the one who only seek to defend their interests and eliminate the rising threat from the other side. The fighting continued until the darkness, as the enemy has gathered the remaining forces and retreated leaving our soldiers to heal the wounds and learn from this engagement."
mongol.25.a:0 "Very well. Our troops have learned a valuable lesson."

#medium-sized-raids
mongol.26.t:0 "Medium Raid Successful"
mongol.26.d:0 "Few weeks of intense planning and careful preparations have paid off, for a few of our divisions have breached the enemy border in multiple locations to later meet together and overcome local garrison guarding military base, infiltrate the munition warehouses and retrieve multiple variants of modern military equipment for our use. \n\nAfter the alert went off, our squadrons concealed the obtained tools and safely transferred them to our side of the border across the well-established and protected corridors. Local commander has excitingly reported that new pieces can be used to equip our troops or utilized for the scientific purposes."
mongol.26.a:0 "More equipment to use! Wonderful!"
mongol.26.b:0 "Very well. Use them for testing."

mongol.27.t:0 "Medium Raid Repelled"
mongol.27.d:0 "Rapid and somewhat reckless advance of our armed forces was intercepted by the enemy border security patrol, who immediately opened fire on sight with our troops retaining the higher ground while trying to establish a solidified defensive position and restructure formations for the renewed advance before the enemy's reinforcements arrive to the disputed area. \n\nThe enemy appeared to be well-aware of our tactics, since before our counterattack could begun, a flanking maneuver was conducted by enemy cavalry regiment, reigning chaos on ill-defended flanks and eliminating a part of our forces in the close combat, giving the rest of the intrusion team to gather shocked survivors, establish a bridgehead to our homelands and retreat as the night settled in."
mongol.27.a:0 "Many mothers will miss their sons today..."

mongol.28.t:0 "Raiding Party Advance Delayed"
mongol.28.d:0 "First stage of the operation was conducted according to the initial procedure at most areas of interest with one single yet vital exceptional case. The regiment was expected to advance into one of the fortified enemy positions and cut down the communication lines, giving the rest of out forces the necessary time to infiltrate the disputed area without too much trouble. \n\nYet the red alert was raised after a jammed rifle of one of our soldiers fired seemingly arbitrary shot, forcing the enemy into close-up fight with our troops. The window of opportunity has passed and without a signal to continue, the remaining forces had to retreat into initial positions while the already entrenched squadron has successfully evacuated the entirety of the military contingent to report back to the command of the occurred misfortune."
mongol.28.a:0 "Improve our regiments."
mongol.28.b:0 "Good. Think of another tactic to learn."

mongol.29.t:0 "Medium Raid Destroyed"
mongol.29.d:0 "Naive enemy invaders thought that they can move into our lands on their behalf and threat our people in those pesky attacks on civilian and military targets! For border security patrols have reported of the successful destruction of the enemy raiding party aimed to steal and plunder our lands! \n\nEnemy advances were detected and their party intercepted in the area where strategic advantage was on our side, allowing a brave cavalry squadron to outflank the enemy and strike into the heart of this pest, forcing the remains of the bandits to retreat from where they came from. Trophies are being handed to the soldiers while local commander gains another medal!"
mongol.29.a:0 "We are proud of our militia and military!"

mongol.30.t:0 "[MON.GetAdjective] Divisions Raided Our Munition Storage"
mongol.30.d:0 "After the local garrison of the borderland military base failed to respond via the usual communication routine, full mobilization of the armed forces in the region was announced and martial law was issued before the panic could spread among the population. \n\nOnly a few hours later, as the rapidly advancing cavalry has reached the positions, the whole horror of enemy's doings was seen, with entire installation missing not only production material, but also machines and recently produced and stored equipment. With such heavy damage done for the economy and military capabilities, it is vital to ensure that nothing like this will happen in the future. "
mongol.30.a:0 "We will have much to rebuild from now on"

mongol.31.t:0 "Raid Party Intercepted"
mongol.31.d:0 "One of our fortified regions has raised a global alarm after an infiltrating enemy squadron fired a shot of unknown nature. Anyway, soldiers were dispatched at positions trying to force the enemy out of well-established entrenched defensive battlelines. \n\nThe fighting continued for a few more hours and with no side clearly getting an advantage, the enemy has retreated leaving the local garrison to question possible motives of such reckless raid. Other border patrols reported some increase in enemy activity in their areas of interest as well."
mongol.31.a:0 "We are always ready to repel their advances!"
mongol.31.b:0 "Great! Learn from the enemy."

mongol.35.d:0 "At the recent Great Khural Assembly the protocols of our diplomatic mission were presented to the public, revealing the whole controversy surrounding the talks and negotiation tactics of some delegation members. \n\nOne of the names was mentioned more often than others, and it is the former prime minister Peljidiin Genden. While some see his behaviour as the sign of iron will and strong unruliness, other see his provocative manners as a lack of skills, education and cleverness, implying that such person cannot retain a high political office in the future. \n\nWe have various options at our disposal, what shall the decision of wise [MON.getLeader] be?"
mongol.35.a:0 "Allow him to remain in office as a foreign minister."
mongol.35.b:0 "Force him into early retirement."
mongol.35.c:0 "Such behaviour cannot be tolerated, arrest, or even better, assassinate him!"

The incident is a very unfortunate turn of event for our country, but perhaps a fortunate one for someone else? We shall see..."

mongol.37.d:0 "One of the leaders of the left opposition, Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir, has arrived in the office of [MON.getLeader] this evening after the end of the working day to discuss the "very urgent matter". \n\nEnlightened by the table lamp in the office, Eldev-Ochir quietly spoke of that many of the party elite now in fear of their life considering the rapid changes in the political climate of the country. He also mentioned that if Choibalsan obtains another military or governmental promotion, his iron grip over the country combined with his contacts in the NKVD might engulf the land into another decade of political violence, which shall be prevented."
mongol.37.a:0 "Choibalsan is too dangerous, let us prepare an insurrection."
mongol.37.b:0 "Assure him that everything is fine."

mongol.38.t:0 "Leftists Seize Power!"
mongol.38.d:0 "The morning session of the States Khural was interrupted by the crowd which gathered in front of the building to demonstrate against the recently passed legislations, claiming that those are only in interest for the governmental elite, but not for a common men and women, The parliamentary guard was then hastily reinforced to prevent further interruptions into the lawmaking processes. \n\nAfter a few hours of shouting, the crowd let their ringleaders to step forward and announce to the guards that those sitting in the parliamentary building act in their own personal interests and not the interests of the masses, showcasing the evidence of governmental corruption. And while the guards were distracted, a few armed men managed to sneak undetected into the building, cut the building communications and dismiss the parliamentary session, followed by the ceremonial procedure where [MON.getLeader] has resigned from his prime-minister position and transferred his powers to the "provisional" minister Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir."
mongol.38.a:0 "It is for the greater good"

mongol.39.t:0 "Choibalsan Launches a Coup!"
mongol.39.d:0 "Despite the officials announcement of the State Little Khural that the countrys political course shall again lean to the left for the next five years, a sizeable part of the rural population under the guidance of pro-[SOV.getAdjective] elements organized massive demonstrations cross country. Clashing with the police, some of the protesters obtained firearms and started raiding ill-defended munition storages around the country, allegedly aiming to establish irregular militia formation to fight the rightful regime! \n\nWe cannot allow some militants to suppress the free will of the people by force, for the time has come to restore the order into the lands we are destined to rule!"
mongol.39.a:0 "To arms!"

mongol.40.t:0 "Mongolia Seeks Closer Ties"
mongol.40.d:0 "Realizing the fragility of their newly established regime, [MON.getNameDef] has sent out their diplomatic mission to ensure our officials that their interpretation of communism allies with our view on it. \n\nDelegation has also presented a few treaty proposals which shall strengthen the bonds between our two countries and ally the governmental course of Mongolia to the course as it is seen by [ROOT.getNamedef] and its leadership in face of [SOV.getLeader], effectively turning their regime into the supervised state of ours."
mongol.40.a:0 "Very well, it is time."
mongol.40.b:0 "It is not of strategic importance."

mongol.41.t:0 "[SOV.getAdjective]s Agree to Closer Ties"
mongol.41.d:0 "Our proposal of extended cooperation between our two states was met with great excitement by [SOV.getAdjective] officials and after a few rounds of discussions on how various internal and external matters shall be conducted, it was agreed to sign the "[SOV.getAdjective]-[MON.getAdjective] Guidance and Assistance Treaty" the following day. \n\nThe agreement effectively entrenches the [SOV.getAdjective] control over the state apparatus in our country, allowing us to dislocate our governmental efforts onto the strengthening country's position on the international arena and to seek to influence our direct neighbours while promoting the revolutionary cause abroad. "
mongol.41.a:0 "We are glad to hear that."

mongol.42.t:0 "Soviets Decline the Request"
mongol.42.d:0 "Despite our best efforts and sincere promises of perpetual alliance, [SOV.getLeader] has officially rejected our humble proposal, stating that "the [MON.getAdjective] interpretation of principles of Marxism-Leninism has a few ideological differences under current circumstances do not allow the governmental structures of both countries to strengthen the internal and external cooperation". \n\nConsidering such unexpected course of actions, we shall best seek to strengthen our own diplomatic foundation and promote the desired communist ideas using our own means and methods."
mongol.42.a:0 "Well, we can do it on our own too."

mongol.49.t:0 "The Hidden Conspiracy?"
mongol.49.d:0 "Revolutionary means of our communist regime have long been questioned among various masses of the people, many of whom have either foreign origin, religious background or nontraditional state of mind. Despite our best efforts to convert many elements of those society leaders and turn them away from rotten ideas of capitalist, imperialist or autocratic origin, their voices still roar among the people, swaying the loyalty and raising questionable thoughts in mind of our men and women. \n\nInitial investigations showcase that the whole propagandistic effort of those people can be traced back to a single circle of popular personalities all of whom are connected to each other in one way or another. \n\nImplying that they are coordinating their efforts, the interior minister Khorloogiin Choibalsan has drafted a plan on how to behead the conspiracy and secure the state from descending into another series of rebellions and revolts."
mongol.49.a:0 "The time has come"

mongol.50.t:0 "The Issue of Intelligentsia"
mongol.50.d:0 "The education of our population is progressing better then ever before, yet new books and learning materials have potentially planted capitalistic or nationalistic ideas into heads of our citizens. \nMany young specialists who came back from student exchange programs with [SOV.GetNameDef] have enriched our schools, institutes and research centres. Yet the question remains, how trustworthy are they? \n\nHow many of them carry the potential seeds of the revolution and can be trusted? We need to know for sure and the methods are well known..."
mongol.50.a:0 "Conduct massive troikas inspections."
mongol.50.b:0 "We have other issues to worry about."

mongol.51.t:0 "Party Reshuffle"
mongol.51.d:0 "Our party is divided between leftists like Choibalsan, rightists such as Anandyn Amar and hudonets, such as former prime minister Peljidiin Genden. Extreme division of a party has lead to rightists capitalistic reforms of 1926-1928 and to devastation caused by the far-leftist approach to collectivization of 1928-1932. \n\nDrastic government changes are having a negative impact on lifes of our people. Constant shift of political compass might be explained by many factors, yet the main reason is clear: our party is infiltrated by the foreign agents and collaborators of [JAP.GetNameDef] or [CHI.GetNameDef]. This can't be tolerated and few suspicious members might need to removed from the government in one way or another."
mongol.51.a:0 "Set everyone in scope and check loyalty carefully."
mongol.51.b:0 "Maybe the problem is our point of view?"

mongol.52.t:0 "Problem with Lamas"
mongol.52.d:0 "Buddhism is deeply entrenched in minds and hearts of our citizens with 10% of our countries population being lamas and monks. Such massive power block cannot be neglected: rebellions of 1932 and Lhumbe plot of 1933 clearly indicate the need of intervention before the situation becomes too tense. Luckily, we already have an experience with limiting llama's power since Choibalsan rise to power. \n\nStaying loyal to the [SOV.GetAdjective]s, their leader [SOV.GetLeader] and principles of communism implies that we shall conduct this operation as soon as possible."
mongol.52.a:0 "We have no other choice."
mongol.52.b:0 "The buddhism carries the true spirit of [MON.GetAdjective] people!"

mongol.53.t:0 "The Question of Leadership"
mongol.53.d:0 "Our informants have gathered evidence of the planned governmental takeover by pro-[JAP.getAdjective] collaborators and imperialist lapdogs, who have managed to smuggle arms across the ill-protected areas of the border and store those at well-known locations. Some of the captured telegrams have mentions of "higher echelons of power" while recently acquired letter points out to the current country leader, [MON.getLeader]. \n\nA round of further investigations have pointed out a few other politicians who are being in regular contact with some counter-revolutionary elements. \n\nWith enough evidence at our disposal, we need to prosecute the responsible and appoint the new Chairman for the upcoming uncertain times"
mongol.53.a:0 "Choibalsan is the only logical choice."

mongol.54.t:0 "[MON.getLeader] was Taken Ill!"
mongol.54.d:0 "In the late evening of the yesterday, [MON.getLeader] was working as per usual on one of the latest governmental decrees concerning the internal situation of our prosperous nation. As he failed to answer the call of his secretary, the latter has arrived at the office to find the collapsed Giant of the Thought on the floor of his cabinet. \n\nDelivered immediately into the Ulaanbaatar Hospital, he was inspected by the local doctors and promptly diagnosed with a severe medical condition which will prevent him operating the country more efficient in the future. \n\nIt remains unknown, on whether the condition will worsen, but it is always better to stay vigilant."
mongol.54.a:0 "What could we do about it?"

mongol.55.t:0 "New Party Successor?"
mongol.55.d:0 "For a long time rumours have been spreading among the people of our country about the physical and mental health of [MON.getLeader], how it affects [MON.GetHerHis] decision making and the overall international prestige of the country represented by [MON.GetHerselfHimself]. \n\nIt appears that our Leader has already planned ahead and considered the transfer of power to a younger generation of communists, some of whom shall completely reaffirm the states policies in the near future. \n\nAfter some considerations, [MON.getLeader] has decided that Chairman of the party shall be..."
mongol.55.a:0 "Tsedenbal, for he has shown his Loyalty to the Cause"
mongol.55.b:0 "Chairman? Why not a Chairwoman?"

mongol.56.t:0 "Mongolia Requests Annexation!"
mongol.56.d:0 "Our economic ties and political influence has reached such unprecedented heights, that the new [MON.getAdjective] government has issued an open decree where their young Assembly has announced a decision to join [SOV.getNameDef] as the integral republic or autonomous okrug. \n\nDespite our brotherhood and sisterhood ties, it is of an upper importance to retain our reputation of a Great, yet not oppressive Power. Moreover, if we do not want other world powers to consider us Stern Imperialists, we better leave those pure souls be to their own demise"
mongol.56.a:0 "Why not though?"
mongol.56.b:0 "We are not Imperialists by any means!"

mongol.57.t:0 "[SOV.getAdjective]s have Declined our Request"
mongol.57.d:0 "Stating that the Brotherhood of our nations will be way more profitable if both nations retain their independent status, [SOV.getLeader] has politely declined the humble request of our young Assembly on the Annexation Request. \n\nIn the secret telegram, the Central Authority notified us that the international pressure upon the [SOV.getAdjective] government is already high enough, therefore they would rather retain the current diplomatic status of our nations."
