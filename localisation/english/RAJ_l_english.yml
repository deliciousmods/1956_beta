 r56_raj.106.t:0 "The Educational Reform Act passes"
 r56_raj.106.d:0 "The most bright and talented of India have long been migrating to the British Isles to get the highest of educations, while leaving their home soil behind. The Viceroy has long been emphasizing the importance of establishing a society in which intellectuals can truly thrive and the reformation of our school and university system is the logical first step towards that goal."
 r56_raj.106.a:0 "A shining future lies before us."
 
 r56_raj.107.t:0 "The Educational Reform Act fails"
 r56_raj.107.d:0 "It is not clear what lead to the heart-breaking defeat of the Educational Reform Act, when it promised so much. But one thing is clear, the Viceroy's hands will be bound on the topic of Education. India wonders what could have been."
 r56_raj.107.a:0 "I'll go to London then, I guess."
 
 r56_raj.108.t:0 "The Insurance Act passes"
 r56_raj.108.d:0 "India is often used as a comparison to many other agrarian, underdeveloped economies. This is mostly dependent on the middling support for urban- and industrialization. However foreign investments into our markets may help accelerate our economy's growth. Owing to this many of the Opposition members flocked to support this landmark bill."
 r56_raj.108.a:0 "We're open for business."
 
 r56_raj.109.t:0 "The Insurance Act fails"
 r56_raj.109.d:0 "What was supposed to be a landmark bill allowing further global investments into the agrarian subcontinent spectacularly failed to pass our Legislative. The Viceroy has invested much time and effort into the act but has failed in convincing many of the Opposition members of its advantages. Foreign observers, keen to invest have now taken a step back, rather seeking to invest their capital into more stable markets."
 r56_raj.109.a:0 "Guess my enterprise has to wait."
 
 r56_raj.110.t:0 "The War Powers Act passes"
 r56_raj.110.d:0 "As German Bf 110s wreaked havoc on the British countryside it was clear that what the Home Isles needed was its empire. And it seems like the Empire answered owing to the most recent success of the War Powers Act in our most honourable Legislative Council. The Indian administration will now be permitted to commit far larger assets towards the Second World War."
 r56_raj.110.a:0 "Off to war we go!"
 
 r56_raj.111.t:0 "The War Powers Act fails"
 r56_raj.111.d:0 "The Act was a hard sell for many Indians, Hindu and Muslim alike. They were dragged into this war, without their consultation or even a slither of consideration and it was predictable to many that the Imperial Legislative, now newly mostly elected, voted against the expansion of the executive's power during wartime."
 r56_raj.111.a:0 "What will London think?"
  
 r56_raj.112.t:0 "Meeting the Legislative"
 r56_raj.112.d:0 "Although most of the members of the Imperial Legislative Council are appointed, their loyalty lies not only with the Viceroy, but also with their personal interest and of those who supply their campaign funds. Nevertheless the meeting with the Council was far from unproductive, as we discussed many of the administration's future plans and already secured some support for them. While of course being everything but a promise, we will need those votes if the Linlithgow Administration intents to be a productive one."
 r56_raj.112.a:0 "We'll wrangle this place someday."
 
 r56_raj.113.t:0 "Meeting the Judicative"
 r56_raj.113.d:0 "The legal system in India has always been hard to grasp as an outsider, with it's many local secondary courts. But an easy first point of contact has to be the Privy Council, situated in London. It has the final say in all matters, but rarely gets involved in Indian affairs. Our secondary goal will be to meet with the native high courts, holding a large amount of power in the provinces. Whatever we can do to secure their loyalty will get the upmost priority."
 r56_raj.113.a:0 "A convoluted net."
 
 r56_raj.114.t:0 "Our First Order of Business"
 r56_raj.114.d:0 "With our contacts in the Legislative and the Judicative secured it is now our choice on where to begin our efforts. Our cabinet has set forth the possibilities of either the expansion of our railway system or the stabilisation of our food supply, whatever we choose to do first will be important for India."
 r56_raj.114.a:0 "Transportation desperately needs reform."
 r56_raj.114.b:0 "Our agricultural situation is dire."

 r56_raj.115.t:0 "The Ministry of Industries and Labour"
 r56_raj.115.d:0 "Some may say the minister of industry is one of the most powerful cabinet members in any administration, so we must consider carefully who is up for the job."
 r56_raj.115.a:0 "Let's tread on the side of caution."
 r56_raj.115.b:0 "Find the best Economists in the country."
 
 r56_raj.116.t:0 "The Ministry of Defence and War Supply"
 r56_raj.116.d:0 "With tensions in the world running high, war may break out at any moment and we must have a minister of defence up for the task."
 r56_raj.116.a:0 "With a landholder we will bolster mobilization."
 r56_raj.116.b:0 "We need an Industrialist building a war machine."

 r56_raj.117.t:0 "The Ministry of Health, Education and Lands"
