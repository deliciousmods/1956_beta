Also uncertain is the future for the caste system widely opposed by the poorer layers of society."

He has been described by his contemporaries as an aspiring and ambitious politician, inheriting his political fever from his father, the first Governor-General of Australia. The world looks upon India, wondering how his Governor-Generalship will impact the subcontinent."
 r56_raj.1.a:0 "Understood."
 
 r56_raj.2.t:0 "The Viceroy's last hours"
 r56_raj.2.desc:0 "The past five years have been exhausting for the Governor-General. They were a time of civil unrest, which Lord Willingdon was accustomed to, gaining heavy experience in dealing with those movements from his time as the Governor of Bombay. The orders from high above stated their goal as being cooperation, but only with those operating within the Raj's legal framework. Following this assignment, he went on an imprisoning spree, which to this day hampers his popularity. Still, he looked back at his time in India as a net-positive, regardless what the Indian population thought of it. But just as every previous Viceroy's reign must come to an end so does his."

Following the high Indian participation many of it's most effective politicians have been invited into the cabinet, outweighing British officials for the first time in history. But just as Lord Willingdon's reign had to end, so does Linlithgow's."

 r56_raj.104.d:0 "The Act has been praised as the nail in the coffin of the frequent famines in India and the Viceroy was sure to highlight it's advantages. Because of this the support among Hindu and Muslim legislators were overwhelming and the bill got passed rather easily."

 r56_raj.105.t:0 "The Agricultural Stabilisation Act fails"

 r56_raj.109.d:0 "What was supposed to be a landmark bill allowing further global investments into the agrarian subcontinent spectacularly failed to pass our Legislative.

 r56_raj.111.d:0 "The Act was a hard sell for many Indians, Hindu and Muslim alike. They were dragged into this war, without their consultation or even a slither of consideration and it was predictable to many that the Imperial Legislative, now newly mostly elected, voted against the expansion of the executive's power during wartime."
 r56_raj.111.a:0 "What will London think?"
  
 r56_raj.112.t:0 "Meeting the Legislative"
 r56_raj.112.d:0 "Although most of the members of the Imperial Legislative Council are appointed, their loyalty lies not only with the Viceroy, but also with their personal interest and of those who supply their campaign funds. Nevertheless the meeting with the Council was far from unproductive, as we discussed many of the administration's future plans and already secured some support for them. While of course being everything but a promise, we will need those votes if the Linlithgow Administration intents to be a productive one."

 r56_raj.113.d:0 "The legal system in India has always been hard to grasp as an outsider, with it's many local secondary courts. But an easy first point of contact has to be the Privy Council, situated in London. It has the final say in all matters, but rarely gets involved in Indian affairs. Our secondary goal will be to meet with the native high courts, holding a large amount of power in the provinces. Whatever we can do to secure their loyalty will get the upmost priority."
