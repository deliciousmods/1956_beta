Also uncertain is the future for the caste system widely opposed by the poorer layers of society."

 r56_raj.1.d:0 "The 22nd Viceroy and Governor-General of India, Freeman Freeman-Thomas Willingdon has been replaced by the newly appointed Victor Hope Linlithgow, who will shortly assume his position as the 23rd Viceroy of India. He has been described by his contemporaries as an aspiring and ambitious politician, inheriting his political fever from his father, the first Governor-General of Australia. The world looks upon India, wondering how his Governor-Generalship will impact the subcontinent."
 r56_raj.1.a:0 "Understood."

 r56_raj.2.t:0 "The Viceroy's last hours"
 r56_raj.2.desc:0 "The past five years have been exhausting for the Governor-General. They were a time of civil unrest, which Lord Willingdon was accustomed to, gaining heavy experience in dealing with those movements from his time as the Governor of Bombay. The orders from high above stated their goal as being cooperation, but only with those operating within the Raj's legal framework. Following this assignment, he went on an imprisoning spree, which to this day hampers his popularity. Still, he looked back at his time in India as a net-positive, regardless what the Indian population thought of it. But just as every previous Viceroy's reign must come to an end so does his."

 r56_raj.3.t:0 "The Appointment of Archibald Wavell"
 r56_raj.3.d:0 "Lord Linlithgow wasn't given an easy job by his appointment to Viceroy and Governor-General, as popular unrest has been steadily growing and could only momentarily be halted with a few political concessions culminating in the 1937 Provincial Elections. Following the high Indian participation many of it's most effective politicians have been invited into the cabinet, outweighing British officials for the first time in history. But just as Lord Willingdon's reign had to end, so does Linlithgow's."

Shortly after arriving in the Viceroy's Mansion in Delhi he worked to somewhat relief Bengal's food supply. He has also been the first Viceroy and Governor-General to discuss self-rule with prominent Indian political leaders, though to the dismay of many these efforts were undermined by London, wishing to hold onto India, no matter the cost."
 r56_raj.4.i:0 "The efforts of Wavell where considered by most of India's politicians as noble, but curtailed by London. Shortly after arriving in the former Viceroy's Mansion in Delhi he worked to somewhat relief Bengal's food supply.

 r56_raj.103.t:0 "The Railway Expansion Act fails"

 r56_raj.104.t:0 "The Agricultural Stabilisation Act passes"
 r56_raj.104.d:0 "The Act has been praised as the nail in the coffin of the frequent famines in India and the Viceroy was sure to highlight it's advantages. Because of this the support among Hindu and Muslim legislators were overwhelming and the bill got passed rather easily."
 r56_raj.104.a:0 "India breathes a sigh of relief."

 r56_raj.105.t:0 "The Agricultural Stabilisation Act fails"
 r56_raj.105.d:0 "Although this Act was seen as a revolutionary measure to prevent famine and to the dismay of most Indians, it failed to get enough support in the chambers of the Imperial Legislative to pass into law.\nAlready drawn up plans to improve drought prevention have now been scrapped."

 r56_raj.108.t:0 "The Insurance Act passes"
 r56_raj.108.d:0 "India is often used as a comparison to many other agrarian, underdeveloped economies. This is mostly dependent on the middling support for urban- and industrialization. However foreign investments into our markets may help accelerate our economy's growth. Owing to this many of the Opposition members flocked to support this landmark bill."
 r56_raj.108.a:0 "We're open for business."

 r56_raj.109.t:0 "The Insurance Act fails"
 r56_raj.109.d:0 "What was supposed to be a landmark bill allowing further global investments into the agrarian subcontinent spectacularly failed to pass our Legislative. The Viceroy has invested much time and effort into the act but has failed in convincing many of the Opposition members of its advantages. Foreign observers, keen to invest have now taken a step back, rather seeking to invest their capital into more stable markets."
 r56_raj.109.a:0 "Guess my enterprise has to wait."

 r56_raj.110.t:0 "The War Powers Act passes"
 r56_raj.110.d:0 "As German Bf 110s wreaked havoc on the British countryside it was clear that what the Home Isles needed was its empire. And it seems like the Empire answered owing to the most recent success of the War Powers Act in our most honourable Legislative Council. The Indian administration will now be permitted to commit far larger assets towards the Second World War."
 r56_raj.110.a:0 "Off to war we go!"

 r56_raj.111.t:0 "The War Powers Act fails"
 r56_raj.111.d:0 "The Act was a hard sell for many Indians, Hindu and Muslim alike. They were dragged into this war, without their consultation or even a slither of consideration and it was predictable to many that the Imperial Legislative, now newly mostly elected, voted against the expansion of the executive's power during wartime."
 r56_raj.111.a:0 "What will London think?"

 r56_raj.112.t:0 "Meeting the Legislative"
 r56_raj.112.d:0 "Although most of the members of the Imperial Legislative Council are appointed, their loyalty lies not only with the Viceroy, but also with their personal interest and of those who supply their campaign funds. Nevertheless the meeting with the Council was far from unproductive, as we discussed many of the administration's future plans and already secured some support for them. While of course being everything but a promise, we will need those votes if the Linlithgow Administration intents to be a productive one."
 r56_raj.112.a:0 "We'll wrangle this place someday."

 r56_raj.113.t:0 "Meeting the Judicative"
 r56_raj.113.d:0 "The legal system in India has always been hard to grasp as an outsider, with it's many local secondary courts. But an easy first point of contact has to be the Privy Council, situated in London. It has the final say in all matters, but rarely gets involved in Indian affairs. Our secondary goal will be to meet with the native high courts, holding a large amount of power in the provinces. Whatever we can do to secure their loyalty will get the upmost priority."
