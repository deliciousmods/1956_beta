 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For Greece, the Great War did not end in 1918. The disastrous war with Turkey and the terrible effects of the National Schism have left many wounds open for the Greek nation. The Great Depression, unemployment, social and political instability, and the rise of radicalism have brought the small country of Greece to a crossroads to decide its future, overcome the many problems, and look ahead as its legacy calls."
