 # Events

 r56_italy.1.t:0 "The King Removes Mussolini from Power"
 r56_italy.1.d:0 "Following an emergency meeting requested by King Victor Emmanuel III, the King met with Mussolini, asking for his resignation, pointing, in particular, to the enormous debt in which [ITA.GetNameDef] finds itself and that the latter has not been able to resolve in almost fifteen years of power, the economic abyss that was the Ethiopian campaign, as well as the problems caused by the embargoes suffered following the invasion.\n\nUnder pressure from the Grand Council of Fascism, which began to turn against him, particularly under the influence of the royalists who tried to make a more prominent place for themselves, Mussolini had no choice but to accept the order, not wishing to face prison. Pietro Badoglio was then appointed Prime Minister. Badoglio, despite his many links with the fascist administration, is seen as a much more moderate figure.\n\nThe King is trying to save the face of [ITA.GetNameDef], whose situation is constantly falling apart."
 r56_italy.1.a:0 "Let's hope the situation can be fixed."

 r56_italy.2.t:0 "The Ethiopian Armistice"
 r56_italy.2.d:0 "One of Badoglio's first objectives was to end the costly conflicts in Ethiopia. The new Foreign Minister, Alfredo Covelli, was sent to negotiate an end to hostilities between our two nations and managed to negotiate peace, but forced us to pay some war reparations for the many civil destructions that took place during the conflict."
 r56_italy.2.a:0 "Better a few repairs for now than a permanent economic abyss."

 r56_italy.3.t:0 "The New Cabinet"
 r56_italy.3.d:0 "A few days after his appointment as Prime Minister, Pietro Badoglio formed his new government. Even if Badoglio still claims to act on behalf of the Partito Nazionale Fascista, the fascist influence has been reduced within the ministries, with the participation of many monarchists in the new cabinet, probably under the impulse of the king, concerned about the new problems that could arise from maintaining the economic and social policies of the fascists."
 r56_italy.3.a:0 "Out with the old and in with the new!"

 r56_italy.4.t:0 "Giovanni Messe's Proposition"
 r56_italy.4.d:0 "Giovanni Messe, Major General, former Commander of the Third Cavalry Division, and Minister of the Interior in the government of Pietro Badoglio, today approached the latter with a rather specific proposal. It was indeed clear to Messe that Badoglio's ultimate goal was the removal of the fascists from power.\n\nMesse suggested using potential monarchists in Blackshirts and other organizations very close to the leaders of the Partito Nazionale Fascista to eliminate the party's leading figures from within. Thus, once deprived of its leaders, eliminating its last elements would be possible without having to shed too much blood."
 r56_italy.4.a:0 "By destroying the vital points, the movement will fall by itself."
 r56_italy.4.b:0 "What if it backfires? We do not need to resort to such dangerous methods!"

 r56_italy.5.t:0 "Death of Arturo Bocchini"
 r56_italy.5.d:0 "Arturo Bocchini, head of both the police but especially of the Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell' Antifascismo, the secret police of the Partito Nazional Fascista, was found dead in his home, two bullets in the head.\n\nBocchini was chosen as the first target due to the fear that the OVRA would discover the government's plot. The position is now vacant, vastly reducing any risk of being uncovered by the OVRA."
 r56_italy.5.a:0 "Excellent."

 r56_italy.6.t:0 "Fascists Blame the Communists for the Assassination"
 r56_italy.6.d:0 "The murder of Arturo Bocchini shocked many executives of the Partito Nazional Fascista. In "Il Popolo d'Italia", the party's official newspaper, one could see \"The resurgent communist threat\" written in large letters, blaming potential members of the Partito Comunista Italiano for the assassination.\n\nLuigi Russo, leader of the Blackshirts, called for increased vigilance by the latter against any element deemed \"anti-fascist\"."
 r56_italy.6.a:0 "At least they're not suspecting us."

 r56_italy.7.t:0 "Murder of the Rosselli Brothers"
 r56_italy.7.d:0 "Carlo Rosselli and Sabatino Rosselli, two exiled anti-fascist activists, who notably participated in the Spanish war alongside the Republicans, were murdered by the French organization "La Cagoule" while they were in Bagnoles-de-l'Orne, Normandy, to be treated for phlebitis they had caught during their fight in Spain.\n\nThey had notably founded the "Giustizia e Libertà" movement alongside other anti-Mussolini exiles, in particular republicans, with ideas ranging from liberalism to socialism."
 r56_italy.7.a:0 "Two less problems."

 r56_italy.8.t:0 "Diplomatic Incident at the League of Nations"
 r56_italy.8.d:0 "In a speech to the League of Nations by Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, taking offense at the Italian invasion and asking for diplomatic help to end the conflict, the Italian journalists present began to make fun of the Emperor.\n\nIn reaction to what he considered \"foolishness\", Nicolae Titulescu, a Romanian diplomat present at the time, replied by asking for the departure of these journalists, going so far as to declare \"To the door the savages!\""

 r56_italy.9.t:0 "Militarization of the Rome Protocols"
 r56_italy.9.d:0 "First signed in 1934 between the governments of Austria, Hungary, and Italy, the Rome Protocols were agreements mainly dedicated to economic cooperation between the three nations and opposing Yugoslavia's territorial integrity. Under [ITA.GetNameDef]'s leadership, the second version of these protocols was signed, including a military alliance between the three nations.\n\nMany see this as [ITA.GetNameDef]'s attempt to find a place in Europe after leaving the League of Nations and to prevent [GER.GetNameDef] from integrating [AUS.GetNameDef]."
 r56_italy.9.a:0 "Perhaps this will guarantee the stability of Central Europe."

 r56_italy.10.t:0 "The Second Stresa Front"
 r56_italy.10.d:0 "Faced with what they considered to be a "rising [GER.GetAdjective] threat", the [ITA.GetAdjective], [FRA.GetAdjective], and [ENG.GetAdjective] governments met again in the city of Stresa to announce the re-creation of the Front of the same name, which had been broken following the Italian invasion of the Abyssinia. The [FRA.GetAdjective] and [ENG.GetAdjective] governments agreed to lift the embargoes on [ITA.GetNameDef] in exchange.\n\nThey aim to maintain the territorial integrity of [AUS.GetNameDef] against [GER.GetNameDef] and ensure that the latter respects the Treaty of Versailles. "
 r56_italy.10.a:0 "Radically different governments united in maintaining their previous victory."

 r56_italy.11.t:0 "The Pact of Steel"
 r56_italy.11.d:0 "The various embargoes suffered by [ITA.GetNameDef] following its invasion of Abyssinia led to its rapprochement with nations different from its traditional allies, in particular [GER.GetNameDef], with whom relations warmed up after Italy agreed to cease its guarantee of Austria, which Germany eventually wished to annex, despite the violation of the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nFollowing the signing of the Pact of Friendship and Alliance between [GER.GetNameDef] and [ITA.GetnameDef], they have undertaken to support each other militarily in the coming years."
 r56_italy.11.a:0 "What will this mean for Europe?"

 r56_italy.12.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Reform the Stresa Front"
 r56_italy.12.d:0 "Fearing that [GER.GetNameDef] would seek to transgress the Treaty of Versailles, mainly through its revenge rhetoric, [ITA.GetNameDef] called on us to reform the Stresa front by ensuring that no unprovoked aggression such as the one that took place in Abyssinia would be repeated.\n\nWe would undertake to guarantee [AUS.GetNameDef]'s territorial integrity and the terms of the Versailles Treaty, which could lead to a military response if necessary."

 r56_italy.14.a:0 "The Entente is reborn!"

 r56_italy.15.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Militarize the Rome Protocols"
 r56_italy.15.d:0 "Citing, in particular, the growing revanchism in [GER.GetNameDef], which could threaten the interests of [AUS.GetNameDef], [HUN.GetNameDef], and [ITA.GetNameDef], the latter suggested extending the Rome Protocols to include a defensive and offensive military alliance.\n\nAccording to them, creating a new bloc in central and southern Europe would make it possible to avoid any suppression of belligerent powers."
 r56_italy.15.a:0 "It would be prudent to accept."
 r56_italy.15.b:0 "This might end up causing an even bigger war; we shall refuse!"

 r56_italy.16.t:0 "[ITA.GetAdjective] Ultimatum"
 r56_italy.16.d:0 "The [ITA.GetAdjective] ambassador declared Romania a strategic region for the Rome Pact, particularly for [ITA.GetNameDef] and [HUN.GetNameDef], and issued an ultimatum to the [ROM.GetAdjective] government.\n\They demand that the entirety of Transylvania be returned to [HUN.GetNameDef], that [ITA.GetAdjective] interests in the oil fields be guaranteed, and that the [ITA.GetAdjective] government have a right of scrutiny over government decisions, including by giving the ambassador a veto.\n\n[ITA.GetNameDefCap] made it clear that any refusal could lead to military misconduct."
 r56_italy.16.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 r56_italy.16.b:0 "We will not give away our independence so easily!"

 r56_italy.17.t:0 "[ROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused the Ultimatum!"
 r56_italy.17.d:0 "Describing the [ITA.GetAdjective] demands as "absurd", the [ROM.GetAdjective] government refused the ultimatum sent a few days ago and rejected any renegotiation. We threatened military reprisals if they refused.\n\nThe question is whether we should carry out these threats or postpone them."
 r56_italy.17.a:0 "They chose their fate."
 r56_italy.17.b:0 "We cannot afford a war at the moment."

 r56_italy.18.t:0 "[ITA.GetNameDefCap] Suggests Closer Military Cooperation"
 r56_italy.18.d:0 "In recent months, our relations with [ITA.GetNameDef] have warmed up, as it has been diplomatically and economically abandoned by its former allies, nominally the former powers of the Entente.\nThe [ITA.GetAdjective] ambassador approached us with a proposal to sign a military alliance between our two nations, intended in particular for assistance in a hypothetical war with [ENG.GetNameDef], [FRA.GetNameDef], or [SOV.GetNameDef].\n\nA rapprochement with [ITA.GetNameDef] would undoubtedly enable us to secure the southern Alps. It would also ensure us some control in the Mediterranean and Africa, two areas that we could no longer control.\n\nHowever, we should not forget the first betrayal we suffered at the beginning of the Great War and our various conflicts with our zones of influence, the latter overlapping in many areas."
 r56_italy.18.a:0 "The Rome-Berlin Axis shall never be defeated!"
 r56_italy.18.b:0 "Where would this lead except to another backstab?"

 r56_italy.19.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] Accepts the Pact"
 r56_italy.19.d:0 "The [GER.GetAdjective] government has responded positively to our proposal for a military alliance, officially sealing friendship and cooperation between our two nations, proving that we do not need to comply with the demands of the Entente democracies."

 r56_italy.21.t:0 "Italy Demands Control over Internal Politics"
 r56_italy.21.d:0 "The [ITA.GetAdjective] ambassador gave us a request directly from Rome. The [ITA.GetAdjective] government demands a right of scrutiny and veto over Albania's internal and external policy, stating that it wants to defend "the interests of the [ITA.GetAdjective] nation within Albania".\n\nHe specified that a refusal of the request could be accompanied by severe economic sanctions or even military action in the event of what they consider to be a "serious attack on the many [ITA.GetAdjective] efforts that have been made in Albania".\n\nAccepting these requests would mean a significant loss of [ALB.GetAdjective] independence."

 r56_italy.23.d:0 "Citing the historical [ITA.GetAdjective] population in the Dalmatian region, the [ITA.GetAdjective] government sent us a request to return the entire province of Dalmatia to [ITA.GetNameDef], with the evacuation of [Root.GetAdjective] troops within 72 hours of the transfer of territory. It has threatened military reprisals in the event of a refusal."
 r56_italy.23.a:0 "If this prevents a war, so be it."

 r56_italy.24.d:0 "The [103.Owner.GetAdjective] government has told us that it will not "bend its knee in the face of a government that does not wish to respect the people living in Dalmatia", and there is an apparent increase in military presence in the region and along their border with us.

 r56_italy.28.a:0 "Our road will be without them."

 r56_italy.29.t:0 "The Regia Marina's Budget Question"
 r56_italy.29.d:0 "Since the end of the Great War, the Italian government has set itself the objective of dominating the Mediterranean and, to achieve this, has launched major projects to modernize the navy. However, these projects have a cost. Thus, part of the budget generally allocated to the army was redirected to the Regia Marina, creating an imbalance in equipment production.\n\nWe could try to adjust the budget to return to something equal for all three branches, but perhaps the key to victory lies in the domination of the seas?"
 r56_italy.29.a:0 "We must return to a balanced budget!"
