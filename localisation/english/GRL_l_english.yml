grl.1.t:0 "The Hull-Kauffmann agreement"
grl.1.d:0 "The [DEN.GetADjective] government has recently fallen to fascist armies, but the colonial territory of Greenland remains free from fascist interference. Conveniently a [DEN.GetADjective] diplomat by the name of Henrik Kauffmann has recently approached us regarding the Greenland situation. He is acting in 'in the Name of the King' and of the authority of the recently exiled [DEN.GetADjective] government.\n\nNuuk officials have contacted Kauffmann with this request as they would prefer [USA.GetADjective] occupation instead of possible occupation by either [ENG.GetNameDef] or [CAN.GetNameDef]. Or even worse, a fascist power. This agreement may be legally dubious in terms of international law... But we have a responsibility to protect all land and the people of the New World from fascist threats; this includes Greenland.\n\nHow should we go about this?"
grl.1.a:0 "Put Greenland under our direct control immediately."
grl.1.b:0 "Let local government in Nuuk take control. However, we'll need to ensure their safety."
grl.1.c:0 "Let's not get involved."
