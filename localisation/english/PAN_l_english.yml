 panama.1.t:0 "Arosemena \"Elected\""
 panama.1.d:0 "Democracy isn't worth preserving. \n\n After abandoning the party that got him elected in first place, Harmodio Arias Madrid decided to keep the power in his small circle of loyal followers and threw all of his support behind his foreign minister Juan Demóstenes Arosemena Barreati. Of course, winning an election against both the party you used to lead and the regular opposition would be quite of a challenge, but Madrid and Barreati were well prepared for the occasion - instead of relying on lazy and unreliable voters, Madrid just did it himself and manufactured his own votes. A few uppity citizens got upset about that and voiced their displeasure, but the detention of the most influential ones quickly shut them up. \n\nThe international community has been mute so far. Claiming that you support grand concepts like "democracy" or "freedom of expression" is easy, organizing embargoes or even military interventions is hard. Besides that, most foreign leaders are content with Barreati - a stable authoritarian regime is much more predictable than a democracy with constantly shifting leaders and values."
 panama.1.a:0 "¡Viva Barreati!"
