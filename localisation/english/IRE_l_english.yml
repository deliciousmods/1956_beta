This faction soon turned their disagreement into armed rebellion and waged a guerrilla warfare campaign for the better part of a year. During this troubled period for the nation, a power vacuum formed. The Irish Catholic Church stepped in to take advantage of this power vacuum and greatly expanded its political influence in the country.\n\nIt's been over a decade since the end of the Irish Civil War but the Church's invisible hand can be felt in almost every facet of Irish politics, and it seems inescapable.
