 mexico_calles.1.d:0 "A Mexico City-Veracruz train was ambushed yesterday by dissidents, killing multiple Mexican politicians from the PRM party. \n\nThe train was ambushed at a bridge, that was rigged with explosives, ruling out a bandit robbery as the motive for the attack. The wreckage discovered by officials was completely destroyed by fire, leaving little behind for investigators. [ROOT.getNameDefCap] has been facing increasing political polarization in the recent years, and now it seems political extremists are now resorting to violence."
 mexico_calles.1.a:0 "Tragic, but who could be behind it?"
  
 mexico_calles.2.t:0 "Calles Captured and Exiled!"
 mexico_calles.2.d:0 "Former President Plutarco Elias Calles, and 3 of his right hand men, have been arrested by orders of President [MEX.GetLeader]. \n\nMexico's leftists have accused Calles of trying to ferment dissent among the right wing against President Cardenas, whom he calls a communist, and possibly force the country into a civil war. \n\nWhen the Mexican authorities stormed the rancho, they arrested Calles laying in his bed, reading a Spanish Translation of Hitler's book "Mein Kampf." Calles was then forced onto a plane in the dead of night, heading for Houston, Texas where he expected to arrive in the morning to leave for San Diego where he will live with his sister.\n\nA cache of weapons, presumably for supplying rebels, were also recovered."

 mexico_pemex.1.t:0 "Oil Worker Strikes"
 mexico_pemex.1.d:0 "President [Root.GetLeader], workers are striking against unfair treatment by the foreign companies that bought out the Aguila oil company. They have blatantly broken many of our laws before, and dealing with them will receive little to no backlash among Mexicans. It is best to nationalize the oil company under the constitutional statute that asserts our ownership over all natural resources. Oil nationalization would help fund our country's industrialization, and if war were to happen we would stand to make substantial profit."

The previous film published was "The Lion has Wings", a movie about the RAF raid on the Kiel Canal, drew such anger that Mexican cinemas were forced to remove the movie. William Jenkins, as far as we know, did nothing expressly wrong if pro-UK films were unpopular with Mexican audiences.

Police scoured the city for the culprits and arrested the leader of the 1th street gang, Hank Leyvas, his girlfriend Dora Barrios, and 1 other Mexican-Americans out of 600 Mexican Americans rounded up by LAPD.

They found a party near the site of the attack, and assuming it was a rival gang they confronted the partiers. A fight broke out between the gang and the partiers, lasting about 10 minutes. By morning, the body of Diaz was found. The coroner report states that Diaz's injuries are consistent with being hit by a car. The prosecution put forward E. Duran Ayres, chief of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office, to state that Mexicans as a whole are bloodthirsty and contain a biological urge to kill past down from their Aztec ancestors."

After the failed Soviet-backed coup in 1929 the PCM was finally outlawed by Cales and his loyalists. \n\nConsidering that their current leader so heavily depends on Soviet guidance and the advice of his much more capable wife, a PCM-led Mexico would be nothing more but a literal puppet state of the USSR in Central America while remaining vastly unpopular internally due to the low support basis. \n\nSince it was decided to embrace the leftist policies, the communist takeover is the reality of the nearest future,, yet we still have a say over who will lead it.

Amaro however is a famous military figure, and draws respect from the nationalists. Despite this, Almazán is seen as the inevitable choice for the right wing candidacy and Amaro's bid is quickly losing support to Almazán's campaign through a series of high profile defections. It is clear that Amaro will inevitably lose as Juan is backed by US interests and people find voting for a candidate that the US would try to overthrow is a fool's errand. However, there are people among the fascist cabal in Mexican politics who want to ensure that Almazán never lives to see election day.

 MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "\n\nMexico stands at the closing days of the Maximato, the period when former president Plutarco Elias Calles held the true power in Mexico using right wing loyalists in both politics and the military. Since 1934, Lázaro Cárdenas del Río has waged a political war to end Plutarco's control over the country and enact his own left wing reforms. Mexico stands at a crossroads while the world prepares for war, as the left wing and right wing battle over control of the country's future and where it stands in the coming new world order." #[RECENTLY UPDATED]
 MEX_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "\n\nThe Maximato has ended and Calles is gone, but the battle between the left and right wings is still raging on. Emboldened by the economic hardship caused by the PEMEX embargoes, the right wing have become polarized and now exist in a state of political civil war over who will become the right wing candidate for the presidency next year. The dominant PRI however now rests at a choice between compromising their ideals with the moderate candidate Camacho or double down on the left wing candidate Mugica." #[RECENTLY UPDATED]
 
 POLITICS_DIONISIO_ENCINA_DESC:0 "Dionisio was described as a polarizing figure, and historians were often found to have very little positive things to say about his leadership. Dionisio was responsible for the fracturing of the largest Mexican communist party, the PCM. He was backed by Soviet agents in charge of spreading communism in Mexico and never acted unless ordered to, and feared that his Soviet handlers would find a more suitable leader for the PCM. This fear caused him to purge anyone who had better leadership skills or charisma from the PCM out of fear that he would be replaced by them, leaving the PCM with a severe lack of good leadership and proactive thinking."
