The train was ambushed at a bridge, that was rigged with explosives, ruling out a bandit robbery as the motive for the attack. The train was found by officials completely destroyed by fire, leaving little behind for investigators. It is not known if the explosion set fire to the cars, or they were set on fire by the attackers to destroy evidence.

When the Mexican authorities stormed the rancho, they arrested Calles laying in his bed, reading a spanish Translation of Hitler's book "Mein kampf." Calles was then forced onto a plane in the dead of night, heading for Houston, Texas. Calles arrived in the morning, and is said to be on his way to San Diego where he will live with his sister.\n A cache of weapons, presumably for supplying rebels, were also recovered."

The previous film published was "The Lion has Wings", a movie about the RAF raid on the Kiel Canal, drew such anger that Mexican cinemas were forced to remove the movie. William Jenkins, as far as we know, did nothing expressly wrong if pro-UK films were unpopular with Mexcian audiences.

It is obvious that Maximino is using his leverage over Jenkins to stop non-fascist influence from gaining a foothold in Mexico. Pro-UK movies however are extremely unpopular with Mexican audiences and prompted Mexican cinemas to stop showing them in some instances. The decision to allow pro-UK movies would please the United Kingdom, but not the Mexican movie goer.

By morning, the body of Diaz was found. The coronor report states that Dia'z injuries are consistent with being hit by a car. The prosecution put forward E.

 MEX_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "\n\nThe Maximato has ended and Calles is gone, but the battle between the left and right wings is still raging on. Emboldened by the economic hardship caused by the PEMEX embargoes, the right wing have become polarized and now exist in a state of political civil war over who will become the right wing candidate for the presidency next year. The dominant PRI however now rests at a choice between compromising their ideals with the moderate candidate Camacho or double down on the left wing candidate Mugica." #[RECENTLY UPDATED]
 
 POLITICS_DIONISIO_ENCINA_DESC:0 "Dionisio was described as a polarizing figure, and historians were often found to have very little positive things to say about his leadership. Dionisio was responsible for the fracturing of the largest Mexican communist party, the PCM. He was backed by Soviet agents in charge of spreading communism in Mexico and never acted unless ordered to, and feared that his Soviet handlers would find a more suitable leader for the PCM. This fear caused him to purge anyone who had better leadership skills or charisma from the PCM out of fear that he would be replaced by them, leaving the PCM with a severe lack of good leadership and proactive thinking."
