 ###EVENTS

 mexico_calles.1.t:0 "Rebels Attack on Civilian Train!"
 mexico_calles.1.d:0 "A Mexico City-Veracruz train was ambushed yesterday by dissidents, killing multiple Mexican politicians from the PRM party. \n\nThe train was ambushed at a bridge, that was rigged with explosives, ruling out a bandit robbery as the motive for the attack. The wreckage discovered by officials was completely destroyed by fire, leaving little behind for investigators. [ROOT.getNameDefCap] has been facing increasing political polarization in the recent years, and now it seems political extremists are now resorting to violence."
 mexico_calles.1.a:0 "Tragic, but who could be behind it?"

 mexico_calles.2.t:0 "Calles Captured and Exiled!"
 mexico_calles.2.d:0 "Former President Plutarco Elias Calles, and 3 of his right hand men, have been arrested by orders of President [MEX.GetLeader]. \n\nMexico's leftists have accused Calles of trying to ferment dissent among the right wing against President Cardenas, whom he calls a communist, and possibly force the country into a civil war. \n\nWhen the Mexican authorities stormed the rancho, they arrested Calles laying in his bed, reading a Spanish Translation of Hitler's book "Mein Kampf." Calles was then forced onto a plane in the dead of night, heading for Houston, Texas where he expected to arrive in the morning to leave for San Diego where he will live with his sister.\n\nA cache of weapons, presumably for supplying rebels, were also recovered."
 mexico_calles.2.a:0 "Calles got the same treatment he gave to so many others."


 mexico_calles.3.t:0 "Calles Rebellion!"
 mexico_calles.3.d:0 "Callista supporters have begun a revolt in Mexico in response to what they call the "sovietification" of Mexico. \n\nWhipped into a frenzy by Plutarco's rhetoric, his supporters have plunged Mexico into yet another civil war. \n\nIt remains to be seen if this rebellion reaches the brutality of the Mexican revolution, which tore Mexico apart for 10 years."
 mexico_calles.3.a:0 "Time to end this farce!"

 mexico_pemex.1.t:0 "Oil Worker Strikes"
 mexico_pemex.1.d:0 "President [Root.GetLeader], workers are striking against unfair treatment by the foreign companies that bought out the Aguila oil company. They have blatantly broken many of our laws before, and dealing with them will receive little to no backlash among Mexicans. It is best to nationalize the oil company under the constitutional statute that asserts our ownership over all natural resources. Oil nationalization would help fund our country's industrialization, and if war were to happen we would stand to make substantial profit."
 mexico_pemex.1.a:0 "Let's make a power play."

 mexico_pemex.2.t:0 "Mexico Nationalizes Oil Companies!"
 mexico_pemex.2.d:0 "[MEX.GetLeader] has announced the nationalization of oil companies within Mexico. The previously foreign companies shall be confiscated and put under the control of PEMEX, the state run oil company. This disproportionately effects UK and Dutch companies, who are demanding their governments go to war. America is largely unsure whether to condone or condemn the nationalization, as the presence in the Mexican oil market was not only negligible, but the nationalization helps their business by eliminating foreign competition."

Lobbyists are demanding war, but it will get politically messy right when Germany's rising power is a much more clear threat. If we wage a war, we will have less manpower, and resources to deal with Germany. The terrain is rough, and it will likely be a drawn out war. Our other option is to embargo them and force them to return our holdings when Mexico realizes it doesn't have the expertise to run an oil company."

 mexico_pemex.6.b:0 "They're trying to starve us out."

 mexico_pemex.7.t:0 "U.S. declares war on Mexico!"
 mexico_pemex.7.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] has announced a declaration of war on Mexico over outrage over the confiscation of oil assets from American companies. [USA.GetLeader] has stated that it must defend American interests, and will not stand for Mexican posturing against American companies. [MEX.GetLeader] has responded that foreign ownership of the oil was not legal to begin with under Mexican law, and that any future president had the legal right to enforce the law. [MEX.GetLeader] has also stated that they will fight to protect their constitution from foreign interests."

 mexico_pemex.8.t:0 "UK declares war on Mexico!"

 mexico_pemex.8.a:0 "My God."
 mexico_pemex.8.b:0 "Dios Mio."

 mexico_pemex.9.t:0 "Compensation"
 mexico_pemex.9.d:0 "Now that we are under an embargo and war has been temporarily averted, it might be time to offer to pay 29 million dollars in reparations to America, who have been demanding compensation for the affected enterprises. This will fully avoid war with the United States and lift the embargo, but place a temporary strain on our budget. However, the expansion of our possible markets would outweigh the penalty."
 mexico_pemex.9.a:0 "They want compensation? I'd like to see them try."
 mexico_pemex.9.b:0 "Pay them compensation, and end this."

 mexico_minor.2.t:0 "Escobar returns to Mexico!"

They accuse him of tampering with Mexican politics by using his media monopoly to turn Mexicans against the United Kingdom. However, our sources say that Jenkins is merely refusing to publish most anti-German films in Mexico, with recent events backing the prudent move. The previous film published was "The Lion has Wings", a movie about the RAF raid on the Kiel Canal, drew such anger that Mexican cinemas were forced to remove the movie. William Jenkins, as far as we know, did nothing expressly wrong if pro-UK films were unpopular with Mexican audiences. This situation could also be used to expel more than just Jenkins or the English, we would have an excuse to expel all of the lawbreakers in the nation to save face as we would not be laying blame on any one party. What should we do?"

They accuse him of tampering with Mexican politics by using his media monopoly to turn Mexicans against  [ENG.getNameDef]. \n\nHowever recent report of the DFS says that Jenkins is linked to Maximino Camacho, and latter is protecting Jenkins politically in exchange for providing business opportunities. Maximino is a known Axis sympathizer, and is said to have a photo of Mussolini hanging over his bed at his mansion in Pueblo. It is obvious that Maximino is using his leverage over Jenkins to stop non-fascist influence from gaining a foothold in Mexico. \n\nPro-UK movies, however, are extremely unpopular within the Mexican audiences and prompted Mexican cinemas to stop showing them in some instances. The decision to allow pro-UK movies would please [ENG.getNameDef], but not the Mexican movie audiences. \n\nThis situation could also be used to expel more than just Jenkins or the [ENG.getAdjective], we would have an excuse to expel all of the lawbreakers in the nation to save face as we would not be laying blame on any one party.

They found a party near the site of the attack, and assuming it was a rival gang they confronted the partiers. A fight broke out between the gang and the partiers, lasting about 10 minutes. By morning, the body of Diaz was found. The coroner report states that Diaz's injuries are consistent with being hit by a car. The prosecution put forward E. Duran Ayres, chief of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office, to state that Mexicans as a whole are bloodthirsty and contain a biological urge to kill past down from their Aztec ancestors."

After the failed Soviet-backed coup in 1929 the PCM was finally outlawed by Cales and his loyalists. \n\nConsidering that their current leader so heavily depends on Soviet guidance and the advice of his much more capable wife, a PCM-led Mexico would be nothing more but a literal puppet state of the USSR in Central America while remaining vastly unpopular internally due to the low support basis. \n\nSince it was decided to embrace the leftist policies, the communist takeover is the reality of the nearest future,, yet we still have a say over who will lead it.

Amaro however is a famous military figure, and draws respect from the nationalists. Despite this, Almazán is seen as the inevitable choice for the right wing candidacy and Amaro's bid is quickly losing support to Almazán's campaign through a series of high profile defections. It is clear that Amaro will inevitably lose as Juan is backed by US interests and people find voting for a candidate that the US would try to overthrow is a fool's errand. However, there are people among the fascist cabal in Mexican politics who want to ensure that Almazán never lives to see election day.

This fear caused him to purge anyone who had better leadership skills or charisma from the PCM out of fear that he would be replaced by them, leaving the PCM with a severe lack of good leadership and proactive thinking."
