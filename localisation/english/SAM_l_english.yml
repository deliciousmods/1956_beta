SAM_afakasi_desc:0 "Afakasi is a term given to Europeans on Samoa. this term has created great divide between the Samoans and Europeans, and has only damaged the relationship between the Samoans and Europeans. the Afakasi's have access to better education, healthcare, and we're treated better during the administration of New Zealand. \n\nWhile the New Zealander government is out of Samoa now, the divide remains."

# CHARACTERS
SAM_olaf_frederick_nelson:0 "Olaf Frederick Nelson"
SAM_OLAF_DESCRIPTION:0 "Nelson was born on 24 February 1883 in Safune to a Swedish-Samoan couple. at first, he studied at the Marist Brothers school in Apia, but at the age of 13 he dropped out and proceeded to become an apprentice at the DH & PG firm. \nAfter leaving DH & PG, Nelson went to Sava'i, his home island, and took over his Father's buisness. he expanded his father's copra trading buisness throughout the Samoa islands, and by his mid-thirties, he was one of the wealthiest people of Apia. which led to him being very influential over the European and Samoan communities in Samoa. \n\nUnder German colonial-governance, Nelson was treated as an equal to those of the Germans. but after New Zealand seized Western Samoa from Germany in the first world war, Nelson was excluded and alienated by the new government. due to this treatment, Nelson turned into one of the major forces in the Samoan independence movement, known as the Mau Movement. \nIn 1927, Nelson founded a newspaper called the Samoan Guardian, in which the newspaper talked about and supported Samoan independence. this would lead to the public being outraged by the colonial-administration's treatment of Nelson, and the government would try to paint Nelson as a unscrupulous and a trouble maker, with no success. \n\nThe colonial administration's desperation to silence Nelson, and the many failed attempts of trying to do so, led the colonial-administration exiling Nelson from Samoa entirely, and into New Zealand. During his years in exile, Nelson took his protests elsewhere, such as the League of Nations in Geneva, and London. He returned to Samoa in 1933 and continued supporting the the Mau Movement. \n\nGeneral Hart, then the New Zealand administrator of Samoa & Tokelau, demanded that Nelson be excluded from all meetings between the Fono, and to swith the leadership of the Mau movement. the Mau insistenced that Nelson should be one of their delegates. General Hart ordered a police raid on the the Mau Headquarters, which led to many of Mau's prominant members being arrested. months after Nelson's return to Samoa, he was charged of being connected to the Mau, for which he was sentenced to 10 more years in exile. \n\nBut things have been changing. the Labour party in New Zealand has recently been making steps to cooperate with the Mau, and stop resorting to violence. does this mean Nelson get to go back to Samoa? \n\nOnly time will tell."
SAM_alfred_turnbull:0 "Alfred Turnbull"
SAM_ALFRED_DESCRIPTION:0 "Alfred was born on Southern Island in New Zealand. at 19, he joined the civil-service. he served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the first world war. \n\nHe was posted to Western Samoa in 1930, initially as a Government Secretary, and in 1935 he was appointed as Acting Administrator, succeeding the brutal General-Hart. Turnbull, unlike his predecessor, he was highly liked by the Samoans, and was a popular figure amongst the Islanders. so much so that a petition was sent to the New Zealand government requesting his appointment, as he was only an acting administrator. \n\nBut do the Samoans want him in full power? as their leader possibly?"
