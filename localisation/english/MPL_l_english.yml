 #THE CHAD BEGINNING
 MPL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever since the formation of the Mandate for Palestine in 1923, instability has ruled the region. \nWith the mass Jewish imigration into the country following the Balfour Declaration, multiple local governments from both sides fight for control over the region, each having their own paramilitary organizations that vastly outnumber the tiny British garrison stationed in the country.\nWith tensions at an all time high following a series of incidents, the question remains: Can the British hold on? Will the region devolve into yet more fighting? Or perhaps, an unexpected solution will arise?"

He couldn’t determine the cause, but this sight was nothing out of the ordinary for him, so he did not pay much attention to it.
