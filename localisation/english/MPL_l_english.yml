 MPL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever since the formation of the Mandate for Palestine in 1923, instability has been the norm. \nWith the mass Jewish immigration into the country following the Balfour Declaration, multiple local governments from both sides fight for control over the region, each having their own paramilitary organizations that vastly outnumber the tiny British garrison stationed in the country.\nWith tensions at an all time high following a series of incidents, the question remains: Can the British hold on? Will the region devolve into yet more fighting? Or perhaps, an unexpected solution will arise?"

Although it was much less comfortable than his life back in Poland, at least he had a strong community to protect him. Besides, it was for a noble cause, wasn't it?\n\n“Stop!” Yair looked to his side to see a fight erupting between a Jew and a couple Arabs. He couldn't determine the cause, but this sight was nothing out of the ordinary for him, so he did not pay much attention to it. Before his Aliyah, he always believed the Jews and Arabs could get along. While it was working out in some areas, his life in Haifa would lower his faith every day.\n\n“One day..”, he thought to himself."

Sure, the violence didn't stop, but the overall feeling had changed. It felt as if the people had gained a bit of hope, Jews and Arabs alike. No one expected the British to stand down, it came as a shock to all equally. But even so, Yair felt a sense of cooperation amongst the people, something he had not felt since his arrival.\n\nPerhaps a change was coming?"

 mandate_palestine.1003.t:0 "A Dream Realized"
 mandate_palestine.1003.d:0 "The market felt different this time. For the first time, Yair saw Arabs and Jews working together effectively. He saw parents with their children, who were usually too afraid to bring them to places like these. He saw elderly people being assisted in carrying their purchases. Such a difference, he thought to himself.\n\nSuddenly, Yair was startled by a crashing sound behind him. He almost instinctively tried to brace himself, thinking it was yet another fight, but he turned around to see that one of the seller's shelves had collapsed, and people were rushing to help pick up the fruits that had fallen on the ground.\n\nYair smiled."

But it was all for nothing.\n\nAs he bled out, he just wished his young son would have a better life than him. Perhaps there was a purpose for his sacrifice. Perhaps there was no other way.\n\nPerhaps."
