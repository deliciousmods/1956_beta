Zinoviev, Bucharin, Trotsky and Kirov have already either fallen victim to the political power struggle or were forced into exile and hiding from NKVD agents. GenSek wrath may fall on anyone who is persuading his or her career within the party too strongly or too weakly. \n\nNikolai Yezhov has started to fear that his position at the NKVD might be in jeopardy, and that [ROOT.GetLeader] might remove him from his current office or worse. He's now using the activities that are currently directed toward finding people who are enemies of the state, and instead using these activities as cover for his current plans to recruit officers and officials into a scheme to remove Stalin from power."

Though this will take time as we have to be careful not to be found out by any foreign agents along the way or by [ROOT.GetLeader] Loyalists.

Our agents report many support offer letters arriving at the Yezhov's office from anonymous sources. The writings of one of the letters was recognized by one of the staff members of our Commissariat to belong to the prominent young general Andrey Vlasov. He was immediately called to Moscow for a discussion of the ongoing operation to overthrow the dictator Stalin. \n\nWhen Vlasov was brought in for a little sit down by the NKVD he seemed to show great interest in our plot and wanted to lend all the help he could.

Their political agenda was unacceptable in times of the communist indoctrination of the proletaria in 20s and early 30s, yet now the times are different with uncertainties of the current government indicating itself clearly. Our informators have met with Pavel Milyukov in Paris and introduced the former Minister of the Foreign Affairs to our plan. After a long evening discussion, he agreed to support our cause under the condition of bloodless revolution without any sort of the foreign involvement. \n\nIn addition multiple NKVD agents have suggested that smuggling in excommunicated communists and other political figures that were exiled might lend to a more stable post Coup Government. This would also lend international legitimacy to our regime in the worlds eyes."

 r56.soviet.22.t:0 "Contact exiled Generals?"
 r56.soviet.22.d:0 "After the conclusion of the Russian Civil War many prominent members of the Imperial Russian Army and White Movement have left the country either in fear of Soviet vengeance or in a hope to acquire the former glory and recognitions abroad. While most of them have changed their names and conceived their military experience behind the mask of the natural talent, a few of them were sill recognized by our agents. These included Anatoly Rogozhin, currently serving in the Yugoslavian border police, and general Konstantin Nechaev who assisted Chinese government as a military advisor. Long and tedious negotiations together with a promises of reestablished military ranks and return of confiscated property have swayed their loyalty in our favor. \n\nOur NKVD agents have suggested that smuggling in excommunicated generals and other military figures that were exiled is most efficient if conducted via the airdrop in a low-population areas. This operation will lead to a more stable and stronger post-Coup military."

Both revolutionaries agreed to take a flight directly to Moscow so that the transition of the power can be conducted as soon as possible. \n\nThe new Congress of the All-Union Communist Party was organized, at which the Revolutionary has held his first major speach since his exile in 1929. A few tears of joy could be spotted on the face of Trotsky as he held an impassioned speech stating that the peasants and workers will enjoy the fruits of the World Revolution in the recent future. Trotsky also stated that "I'll bring hope to workers across the world, as we set the Revolution back on track!""
