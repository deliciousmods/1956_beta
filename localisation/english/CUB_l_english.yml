 cuba.1.t:0 "General Election"
 cuba.1.d:0 "It is now time for the [CUB.GetAdjective] people to be called to the polls to elect their leader.\nThis year, two main forces are present. The Tripartite coalition, composed of the Liberal Party, National Unity, and Republican Action, has the support of the many forces behind the 1933 revolution, particularly General Fulgencio Batista.\nAgainst them, the relatively conservative National Democratic Association, led by former President Mario García Menocal, who had led Cuba in particular during the First World War."
 cuba.1.a:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez"
 cuba_tripartite_coalition_party_long:0 "Coalición Tripartita"
 cuba.1.b:0 "Mario García Menocal"
 cuba_democratic_national_association_party_long:0 "Asociación Nacional Democrática"

 cuba.2.t:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez's Inauguration"
 cuba.2.d:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez was inaugurated as Cuba's seventh president following his election earlier this year.\nIdeologically supported by the forces behind the 1933 revolution, he intends to continue the social reforms implemented by successive administrations since Ramón Grau's 100-day government."
 cuba.2.a:0 "We act for the [CUB.GetAdjective] people."

 cuba.3.t:0 "Mario García Menocal's Inauguration"
 cuba.3.d:0 "Mario García Menocal was inaugurated as the seventh president of Cuba today, following his victory in the election earlier this year. Menocal is remembered for his time in office as the 3rd president of Cuba, being a strong ally of corporations and businesses. \n \n During his tenure, Menocal spent far in excess of the federal budget, leaving the country in over $40,000,000 of debt, and was accused of using fraud to win re-election in 1916. This in turn led to an unsuccessful revolt in the army, led by former president José Miguel Gómez. \n \n With Menocal back in power, it's sure to cause a new wave of instability and uncertainty in the days to come."
 cuba.3.a:0 "Let's hope for the best..."

 cuba.4.t:0 "Batista Marches on Havana!"
 cuba.4.d:0 "Declaring that Mario García Menocal's government betrayed not only the 1933 revolution but also the entire [CUB.GetAdjective] nation, Fulgencio Batista called on the army to oppose and overthrow the government.\nJ. Butler Wright, the [USA.GetAdjective] ambassador to [CUB.GetNameDef], announced that [USA.GetNameDef] supported the current government.\nThe Havana garrison has still not chosen sides but could well change everything."
 cuba.4.a:0 "The garrison sides with the government, and the coup fails."
 cuba.4.b:0 "The garrison supports Batista, and the coup succeeds."
 cuba_revolutionnary_party_long:0 "Partido Revolucionario Cubano"

 cuba.5.t:0 "President Gomez Impeached!"
 cuba.5.d:0 "Despite Miguel Mariano Gómez's promised extensive programs, he found himself with increasing opposition, particularly in the Congress and with the army chief, Fulgencio Batista, despite being his supporter during the election.\n\nFollowing the veto of the nine-cent law, Miguel Mariano Gómez was officially dismissed by Congress, and Vice-President Federico Laredo Brú was inaugurated as President of Cuba."
 cuba.5.a:0 "Let's hope he will meet the expectations of Congress and the people."

 cuba.6.t:0 "[CUB.GetNameDefCap] Suggests a War against Spain"
 cuba.6.d:0 "Declaring that the apparent neutrality that the Spanish regime is trying to show is in reality only a façade hiding secret aid to the war effort, the [CUB.GetAdjective] government has suggested a declaration of war against fascist Spain.\n\nSuch a declaration is not made lightly, especially against a currently neutral country. There is little doubt, however, that Spain's support is oriented towards the forces of the Axis."
 cuba.6.a:0 "It's time to avenge the Second Republic."
 cuba.6.b:0 "It would be too dangerous."

 cuba.7.t:0 "War with Spain Refused!"
 cuba.7.d:0 "Citing that the war is already long enough, a declaration of war against a country as big as Spain would only make it more brutal and murderous; our plan for a war against nationalist Spain has been rejected."
 cuba.7.a:0 "At least we tried."

 cuba.8.t:0 "Communist Sympathizers Attempt to Seize Power"
 cuba.8.d:0 "Many communist parties, including former exiles, have gathered in Santo Domingo today to demand the government's resignation and the establishment of a socialist system. They are very numerous and seem to have received foreign weapons."
 cuba.8.a:0 "The government falls and the communists take over."
 cuba.8.b:0 "The government holds on."

 cuba.9.t:0 "The [DOM.GetAdjective] Revolution Crushed"
 cuba.9.d:0 "Despite our support in terms of material, it seems that the [DOM.GetAdjective] revolutionaries failed to bring down the government. Those who were able to escape tell us that many of those present in Santo Domingo were arrested and may well end up executed. What should we do?"
 cuba.9.a:0 "If we cannot liberate them from the inside, we will do it from the outside!"
 cuba.9.b:0 "We will come back later."

 cuba.14.t:0 "Fate of Batista"
 cuba.14.d:0 "Fulgencio Batista has been a controversial figure in [ROOT.GetAdjective] politics, and exerts a great deal of influence throughout our country. This causes a great many issues for us, and thusly it's in our best interests to find a solution to the problems he causes; the sooner the better."
 cuba.14.a:0 "Exile him!"
 cuba.14.b:0 "Seeking a compromise would be an ideal outcome."

 cuba.15.t:0 "Proposal for Hispaniolan Unification"
 cuba.15.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetAdjective] and [DOM.GetAdjective] governments have approached us with an interesting proposal, to unite the island of Hispaniola under one government, that of the [DOM.GetAdjective]s. What shall our response be?"
 cuba.15.a:0 "We are stronger together."
 cuba.15.b:0 "Pah! What are they plotting?"

 cuba.16.t:0 "Caribbean Unity?"
 cuba.16.d:0 "Fulgencio Batista's government has approached us with a proposal for greater cooperation, through the rule of one government in the Caribbean isles. While this would mean we give up our own power, it would certainly strengthen and unify the Caribbean."
 cuba.16.a:0 "A good proposal."
 cuba.16.b:0 "We prefer to maintain our autonomy."

 cuba.17.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Offers Sugar for Oil"
 cuba.17.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has come to us with a very tempting offer. Being one of the limited number of sugar sources, they're offering us a steady supply of sugar in exchange for a small cut into our oil production. Shall we accept?"
 cuba.17.a:0 "An interesting initiative."
 cuba.17.b:0 "Sugar is the fortune of the old."

 cuba.18.t:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective] Accept our Proposal"
 cuba.18.d:0 "Our ambassador in Moscow had received a response from the Central Secretary of the Communist Party and telegraphed immediately about the [SOV.getAdjective] readiness to cooperate on the international raw material markets! \n\nThe delivery of first 200 000 tons of sugar can be sent in immediately with a million more well on the way to the harbours of our nation."
 cuba.18.a:0 "A lucrative deal."

 cuba.19.t:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective] Refuse our Proposal"
 cuba.19.d:0 "[SOV.getLeader] in his recent telegram mentioned that "They have enough sweets in their communist utopia", implying that such deal will not benefit the [SOV.getAdjective] consumption society. Our ambassador refused to quote the next part of the response from Gensek."
 cuba.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 cuba.20.t:0 "[CUB.GetName] Seizes [1050.GetName]"
 cuba.20.d:0 "[CUB.GetAdjective] forces have launched an ambitious attack on the naval base of [1050.GetName] and successfully landed and established a beachhead, quickly overwhelming the small garrison present there and later capturing the main naval base.\n\nIn a press conference sometime later the [CUB.GetAdjective] leader, [CUB.GetLeader] stated that [1050.GetName] is a rightful part of [CUB.GetNonIdeologyName] and seeks to expel all imperialists from the [CUB.GetAdjective] mainland. Obviously this is absurd, it's just how we respond to the matter, some people are calling for war against [CUB.GetNonIdeologyName] where others are skeptical about wasting lives over a small naval base."
 cuba.20.a:0 "We will not be stepped on like this!"
 cuba.20.b:0 "We have a lot to learn from this."
 cuba.20.c:0 "A great victory!"

 cuba.21.t:0 "[1050.Owner.GetName] Victory at [1050.GetName]"
 cuba.21.d:0 "The superior defenders of [1050.GetName] have successfully defended against the [VEN.GetAdjective] landings and denied them a successful beachhead. [CUB.GetAdjective] forces have been forced to withdraw, as a result of which the naval base firmly remains in [1050.Owner.GetNameDef] hands."
 cuba.21.a:0 "That'll teach them!"
 cuba.21.b:0 "A disaster!"

 cuba.22.t:0 "[CUB.GetAdjective] Provocation at [1050.GetName]"
 cuba.22.d:0 "Recently, [CUB.GetNameDef] has started probing attacks against our forces in [1050.GetName]. Our reconnaissance has also reported that their forces have been gradually mounting nearby to the area. With this in mind, it seems imminent that [CUB.GetAdjective]s will launch a full-scaled attack."
 cuba.22.a:0 "We must halt this!"

 cuba.23.t:0 "[CUB.GetNameDefCap] Proposes Non-Agression Pact"
 cuba.23.d:0 "[CUB.GetNameDefCap] has approached us proposing a pact of non-agression between our two countries to preserve peace and cooperation in the Caribbean. The [CUB.GetAdjective] leader, [CUB.GetLeader] as cited personal connections between him and [ROOT.GetLeader] as a grounding for further cooperation."
 cuba.23.a:0 "For our [CUB.GetAdjective] friends!"
 cuba.23.b:0 "We are not of kin, [CUB.GetLeader]."

 cuba.24.t:0 "[DOM.GetNameDefCap] Signs the Pact"
 cuba.24.d:0 "[DOM.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our proposal for a non-agression pact. [DOM.GetLeader] has endorsed the proposal as a great step towards cooperation between our two countries. It appears that Caribbean cooperation is more likley than ever."
 cuba.24.a:0 "I knew we always had a friend in [DOM.GetLeader]."

 cuba.25.t:0 "[DOM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 cuba.25.d:0 "[DOM.GetNameDefCap] has refused our proposal for a non-agression pact. [DOM.GetLeader] has stated that he sees no reason to cooperate with us despite personal connections between our two leaders. It appears that Caribbean cooperation is less likley than ever."
