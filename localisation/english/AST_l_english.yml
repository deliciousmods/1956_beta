 r56_australia.1.d:0 "Isaac Isaacs' term as Governor-General is over. He will be remembered as the first Australian Governor-General and for his outstanding frugality.\n\nOf the candidates recommended to replace him, the Prime Minister has decided to return to a British Governor-General and offered Alexander Hore-Ruthven.\n\nHe was previously the Governor of New South Wales and South Australia before that where he used his influence to help the state during the start of the Great Depression."
 r56_australia.1.a:0 "Lord Gowrie will make a good Governor-General."

 r56_australia.2.d:0 "Alexander Hore-Ruthven's term as Governor-General is over.

 r56_australia.4.t:0 "The Death of Joseph Lyons"
 r56_australia.4.uap:0 "Prime Minister Joseph Lyons has suffered a heart attack while being driven from Melbourne to Sydney. He was collecting his son from college at the time. As the first Prime Minister to die in office, there is no constitutional precedent for who should be appointed as his successor. The lack of a deputy leader for the UAP has complicated matters, and it will be some time before a new leader of the UAP can be chosen. Earle Page, leader of the Country Party and deputy Prime Minister, has been selected to serve as interim Prime Minister until the UAP can vote on their new leader.\n\nAt the age of 59, Lyons contemplated his retirement and wished to spend more time with his young children. However, the lack of a successor led the party to pressure him to stay. Lyons will be remembered for keeping the country together as it struggled from the Great Depression."
 r56_australia.4.labor:0 "Former Prime Minister Joseph Lyons has suffered a heart attack while collecting his son from college. Since his defeat in the 1937 elections, he was reportedly enjoying his retirement and was spending a lot of time with his young children and renovating his home in Devonport.\n\nLyons will be remembered for keeping the country together as it struggled from the Great Depression."
 r56_australia.4.a:0 "He served his country well."

 r56_australia.5.t:0 "Robert Menzies Elected Prime Minister"
 r56_australia.5.d:0 "The UAP elected former deputy leader Robert Menzies as its new leader, and he has been sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Australia. In an act that has shocked Parliament, Interim Prime Minister Earle Page has refused to serve under Menzies and in the House made an extraordinary attack upon Menzies, accusing him of incompetence and cowardice for failing to enlist during the Great War. The Country Party was quick to respond and ousted Page as its leader.\n\nHowever you look at it, it is a lousy way to begin your premiership."
 r56_australia.5.a:0 "Let's hope he'll unite the country."

 r56_australia.7.t:0 "The Death of John Curtin"
 r56_australia.7.uap:0 "Labor Party leader John Curtin has died today at the age of 60. His health deteriorated over the last few months, and he had a heart attack the previous year. The long-serving leader of the Labor Party had been battling with the UPA for years, and his socialist policies were often divisive. He will be remembered as a great leader and a man who did his best to serve Australia and its people."
 r56_australia.7.labor:0 "Prime Minister John Curtin has died today at the age of 60. His health deteriorated over the last few months, and he had a heart attack the previous year. The long-serving leader of the Labor Party has proven popular and united the country to make great strides in reducing unemployment and dragging Australia out of the Great Depression.\n\nHe will undoubtedly be remembered as a great leader."

Labor lost power in a landslide to the UAP in the 1931 elections. The UAP and Country Party reformed their coalition before the 1934 elections, while Labor's internal issues caused a split. But now, under the leadership of John Curtin, the Labor party is looking to regain its lost ground. But can it win over the masses?"
 r56_australia.8.a:0 "The UAP/Country coalition wins."
 r56_australia.8.b:0 "Labor wins."

 r56_australia.9.d:0 "It's election time. Once again, the UAP/Country coalition is up against Labor for all 74 seats in the House of Representatives and 19 Senate seats. The death of Joseph Lyons has left the UAP under the control of Robert Menzies. The new leader hasn't managed to capture the popularity of his predecessor. Meanwhile, John Curtin's supporters are growing in number. Who will win the majority this time?"
 r56_australia.9.a:0 "The UAP/Country coalition wins."
 r56_australia.9.b:0 "Labor wins."

 r56_australia.10.t:0 "1943 Federal Election"
 r56_australia.10.d:0 "Australians want change. Labor is looking strong in the 1943 elections.

 r56_australia.12.a:0 "The Liberal/Country coalition wins."
 r56_australia.12.b:0 "Labor wins."

 r56_australia.13.t:0 "Robert Menzies Resigns"
 r56_australia.13.d:0 "Under mounting opposition and deadlock in parliament, Prime Minister Menzies has announced his intention to resign. In a last-ditch effort by the UAP to keep him in power, the cabinet urged a national unity government to be formed with Labor. However, Labor refused such an agreement. Having lost all support from parliament, he has stepped down.\n\nDespite Menzies advising the Governor-General to make John Curtin Prime Minister, a joint UAP-Country Party conference chose Country Party leader Arthur Fadden as the new Coalition leader and Prime Minister. Bitter and dejected, Robert Menzies almost quit politics but was persuaded to become Minister for Defence Co-ordination in Arthur Fadden's new cabinet."
 r56_australia.13.a:0 "Let's hope Fadden can keep [AST.GetNameDef] together."

 r56_australia.14.t:0 "Vote of No Confidence"
 r56_australia.14.d:0 "After only 40 days as Prime Minister, Arthur Fadden has been defeated in a vote of no confidence led by the Labor opposition. Having been unable to secure the confidence of parliament, his death-nail came when the House of Representatives rejected his proposed budget. Unable to break the deadlock of Menzie's government, he will be remembered as the shortest-serving Prime Minister to date. John Curtin and the Labor Party will now seek to form a new government."
 r56_australia.14.a:0 "It's time for John Curtin to take the lead."

 r56_australia.19.t:0 "[AST.GetNameDefCap] Requests Integration of New Zealand"
 r56_australia.19.d:0 "The idea of New Zealand being a state of Australia has existed since before the founding of our nations. However, this never happened due to the distance between us, political and economic differences, and Australia's treatment of its indigenous population. However, recent talks between diplomats have brought up New Zealand talking its place as an [AST.GetAdjective] state. While it might not be a popular choice, the benefits might prove fruitful in this ever dangerous world."
 r56_australia.19.a:0 "It's time that we put aside our differences and unite."

 r56_australia.22.t:0 "The [NZL.GetAdjective] Crisis"

[AST.GetNameDefCap] has demanded several times that [NZL.GetNameDef] join [AST.GetNameDef] as a state. However, such an idea has been shot down in [NZL.GetNameDef], and diplomatic relations between our two Dominions have broken down.

 r56_australia.23.d:0 "Ambassadors from [AST.GetNameDef] have requested that we transfer the remote and strategic Christmas Island to [AST.GetAdjective] control. The island, known for its phosphate mining, was annexed by the British in 1888 and has been under the governorship of the Straits Settlements since. It is home to many Malayan workers, and it acts as a safe harbor for any ships seeking shelter in the Eastern and Southern Indian Ocean. Due to its remoteness, [AST.GetNameDef] is in a better position to govern the island, and they are offering payments to cover the losses from phosphate mining. Should we accept?"
 r56_australia.23.a:0 "The islands are better cared for under their governorship."
 r56_australia.23.b:0 "They'll never have Christmas Island."

 r56_australia.26.d:0 "[AST.GetNameDefCap] has proposed a non-aggression treaty between our two nations to keep peace and prosperity in the South Pacific.
