 DOD_hungary.1.desc:0 "In a speech in Budapest, [HUN.GetLeader] has demanded that his [AUS.GetAdjective] subjects be permitted to return to his rule.

 DOD_hungary.6.t:0 "Referendum Refused"
 DOD_hungary.6.desc:0 "[AUS.GetADjective] leader [AUS.GetLeader] has publicly declared that the entire country is united in their opposition to the Habsburgs and that the very idea of a referendum on [AUS.GetAdjective] independence is utterly absurd. "

 DOD_hungary.7.t:0 "Guiding the Referendum"
 DOD_hungary.7.desc:0 "The [HUN.GetAdjective] offer of a referendum has put us in a tight spot internationally.

 DOD_hungary.10.desc:0 "With the recent, dramatic shifts in the political landscape of the Balkans, the question of our relationship with the new Austro-Hungarian Empire has come up repeatedly. Today, the [HUN.GetADjective] ambassador has handed over an official note, formally requesting that we declare our position towards the Empire. The Habsburgs claim that, as old crown lands, Bohemia and Moravia belong to them.\n\nHowever, [HUN.GetLeader] has indicated that he would accept a compromise solution, with himself nominally the head of state of our country, but with very little real power."
 DOD_hungary.10.a:0 "We shall return to the Empire."

 DOD_hungary.11.desc:0 "Following discussion at the highest level that ran late into the night, the [CZE.GetAdjective] government has decided to accept our offer and proclaimed [HUN.GetLeader] the King of Bohemia and Margrave of Moravia. The soldiers of the former Czech Army have sworn an oath to their new King and Emperor, and the civil administration of the realms has been fully integrated."
 DOD_hungary.11.a:0 "Another step on the way to reclaim our birthright."
 DOD_hungary.12.t:0 "Bohemia Agrees to Closer Relationship"
 DOD_hungary.12.desc:0 "Treading a careful balance between the republican and the monarchist factions in his government, [CZE.GetLeader] has opted for a compromise solution. [HUN.GetLeader] will be declared King of Bohemia and Moravia, but the [CZE.GetAdjective] constitution will limit his powers to only act with the advice and consent of parliament."

 DOD_hungary.13.t:0 "[CZE.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Advances"
 DOD_hungary.13.desc:0 "[CZE.GetNameDefCap] has refused to entertain any settlement or agreement concerning our future relationship. When our ambassador arrived at the foreign office to discuss the official note he had delivered earlier, he was told that there was nothing to talk about and quickly shown out the door.

 DOD_hungary.20.t:0 "The War in [HUN.GetNameDef]"
 DOD_hungary.20.desc:0 "Following the outbreak of war in [HUN.GetNameDef], the idea of supporting them has come up repeatedly. Conservative newspapers have clamored for action to help the [HUN.GetAdjective], claiming that the King can not reasonably be expected to sit idle while his son, now the King of Hungary, is under attack. A letter by an anonymous group of Army officers has been leaked to the press, stating that many soldiers would be willing to go to [HUN.GetNameDef] to fight if the government would let them.\n\nThe government has met to discuss options."

 DOD_hungary.21.desc:0 "Despite multiple appeals from both the [SWE.GetAdjective] king and elements of the [SWE.GetAdjective] military, the government of [SWE.GetNameDef] has refused to allow anyone to come to our aid.

 DOD_hungary.21.a:0 "We are on our own."
 DOD_hungary.22.t:0 "[SWE.GetNameDefCap] Sends Support"
 DOD_hungary.22.desc:0 "While the [SWE.GetAdjective] government is officially neutral, it has allowed a surprisingly large number of soldiers and officers to go on extended leaves of absence and even allowed them to take their weapons with them.

 DOD_hungary.23.desc:0 "In a development surprising even experienced diplomats, the [SWE.GetAdjective] government has announced that they consider our survival a core national interest of [SWE.GetNameDef].

 DOD_hungary.23.a:0 "Will they get here in time?"
 DOD_hungary.24.t:0 "[SWE.GetNameDefCap] is Under Attack"
 DOD_hungary.24.desc:0 "[SWE.GetNameDefCap] has become embroiled in a bloody conflict. Making a rare appearance before both houses of parliament, the King has noted that he is perturbed about his old home and particularly about the fate his father and family should suffer if [SWE.GetNameDef] were to be defeated.

 DOD_hungary.27.desc:0 "The [HUN.GetAdjective] government has issued a statement proclaiming that any attack on Sweden is considered an attack on [HUN.GetNameDef]. The [HUN.GetAdjective] Military has been placed at high alert and is expected to enter the war as soon as mobilization is complete."

 DOD_hungary.30.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Offers Rapprochement"
 DOD_hungary.30.desc:0 "The [HUN.GetAdjective] government has approached us with the offer to renegotiate the Treaty of Trianon. Under their proposal, the restrictions on army size in the treaty would be changed to allow [HUN.GetNameDef] to bring its current army to full strength. [HUN.GetNameDefCap] would further be permitted to spend a greater portion of its budget expanding and modernizing its military industries.\n\nWith a democratic government firmly in charge of the country, there is considerable support for the scheme in our diplomatic service."
 DOD_hungary.30.a:0 "A reasonable request."
 DOD_hungary.30.b:0 "And what would they need a bigger army for?"
 DOD_hungary.31.t:0 "The Revision of Trianon"
 DOD_hungary.31.desc:0 "The government of [HUN.GetLeader] has scored a major political victory, as [From.GetNameDef] has just ratified the Revision to the Treaty of Trianon. We are now allowed to reinstate conscription and can openly earmark money to construct military factories in the budget."
 DOD_hungary.31.a:0 "Excellent."
 DOD_hungary.32.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Negotiate"
 DOD_hungary.32.desc:0 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has refused to budge on the rearmament issue. Talks have broken down almost immediately, with the [From.GetAdjective] delegation stalling at every opportunity and turning minor matters such as the seating order into hour-long debates. It is clear that they don't intend on letting us rearm, but they want us to be the ones who walk out of the talks."
 DOD_hungary.32.a:0 "Very well; we shall indulge them."
 DOD_hungary.32.b:0 "Approach [FRA.GetAdjective] for help."

 DOD_hungary.33.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Appeals for Support"
 DOD_hungary.33.desc:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] has recently started to feel out its neighbors about revising some of its restrictions after the last war. Specifically, they want to reintroduce conscription and expand their military industries. The [HUN.GetADjective] argument is that the world is becoming less safe with every passing day and that they need a good military to defend themselves. [From.From.GetNameDefCap] thinks otherwise."
 DOD_hungary.33.a:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] should be permitted limited rearmament."
 DOD_hungary.33.b:0 "We can't upset the balance of power in the region."
 DOD_hungary.34.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Supports [HUN.GetNameDef]"
 DOD_hungary.34.desc:0 "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has made it clear that his government is firmly against our decision to deny the [HUN.GetAdjective]s the right to rearm. He further clarified that should we insist on [HUN.GetNameDef] remaining disarmed, his government will take consider that when diplomatic issues concerning us arise in the future.\n\nIn other words, they are willing to gamble our current good relations on it."
 DOD_hungary.34.a:0 "Let us pray they are not wrong."
 DOD_hungary.34.b:0 "We must be firm on this issue."
 DOD_hungary.35.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Support"
 DOD_hungary.35.desc:0 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has informed us that they consider revising the Treaty of Trianon to be a purely internal matter of the countries concerned and have refused to get involved in the issue.

 DOD_hungary.35.a:0 "Damn them."
 DOD_hungary.36.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Remains Stubborn"
 DOD_hungary.36.desc:0 "Despite heavy political pressure from [From.From.GetNameDef], [From.GetNameDef] has categorically refused to discuss the issue.

 DOD_hungary.40.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Renounces the Treaty of Trianon"
 DOD_hungary.40.desc:0 "[HUN.GetLeader] today publicly stated that he no longer considers [HUN.GetNameDef] bound by the treaty. More than that, he declared it null and void, claiming that it was forced on Hungary at gunpoint and therefore never legally binding. The [HUN.GetAdjective] government has not bothered to inform us of their decision formally.\n\nMany in the government favor a strong reply. If we show the [HUN.GetAdjective]s that we are not afraid, they might fold. However, they might also decide that we are bluffing."

 DOD_hungary.41.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Issues an Ultimatum"
 DOD_hungary.41.desc:0 "Our recent decision to abandon the Treaty of Trianon has been met with a surprisingly strong rebuttal by [From.GetNameDef]. [From.GetLeader] reportedly demanded that the [From.GetAdjective] military prepare a plan for intervention at once. Meanwhile, the [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has asked that we clarify our statements regarding the Treaty, suggesting that the military option is still on the table."
 DOD_hungary.41.a:0 "They are clearly bluffing."
 DOD_hungary.41.b:0 "There appears to have been a misunderstanding."
 DOD_hungary.42.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Folds"
 DOD_hungary.42.desc:0 "Despite our strongly-worded statements about the Treaty of Trianon, [From.GetNameDef] has not made any moves to stop us. In a recent press conference, [From.GetLeader] did not answer any questions about our decision to abandon the Treaty. This clearly shows what everyone already suspected: [From.GetNameDef] is nothing but a paper tiger."
 DOD_hungary.42.a:0 "As expected."
 DOD_hungary.43.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Back Down"
 DOD_hungary.43.desc:0 "It appears that our warning to [HUN.GetNameDef] has fallen on deaf ears.
