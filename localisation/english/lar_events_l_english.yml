With France and Italy being the main powers interested in expanding their empires, concessions will have to be made to [SPA.GetNameDef] and [POR.GetNameDef] to convince them to join the alliance and go to war to achieve these goals.\n\nWhile [POR.GetLeader] will most likely attempt to secure support for the long-held plan to unite Angola and Mozambique, [SPA.GetLeader] will have to be bought by surrendering parts of the French North African territories."

 lar_congress_of_paris.2.t:0 "Redrawing the Map of Africa"
 lar_congress_of_paris.2.desc:1 "In the first round of negotiations, the French delegation offered a simple split of the continent right down the middle, giving us claims over Egypt, the Sudan and further south into Kenya. While the proposal is light on details - and mostly concerns territories that neither of us actually controls - it promises French support for the conquest of a large African empire."

 lar_congress_of_paris.3.desc:1 "The delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has agreed to the proposed territorial changes in principle.

 lar_congress_of_paris.4.desc:1 "The delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has declared the negotiations over. Citing a fundamental difference of opinion about the proposed changes, they have left Paris to return to [From.GetNameDef].\n\n Following their hasty departure, the [From.GetAdjective] ambassador declared that the [From.GetAdjective] government does not consider itself bound by any treaty of mutual assistance or alliance with us any further."
 lar_congress_of_paris.4.a:1 "All the more for us."
 lar_congress_of_paris.5.desc:1 "While the other delegations in Paris have been arguing about who should get territories none of their countries actually control, our diplomats have been pushing for a more achievable goal. The French government has indicated that it is favorably disposed to our proposal to ceede Morrocco to us in return for our promise to support them in any upcoming war. This would connect our holdings in North and West Africa."

 lar_congress_of_paris.6.desc:1 "While our lack of hard power has made it difficult for our diplomats in Paris to affect the proceedings very much, we were nonetheless offered support to take the territories between Angola and Mozambique, plus the possibility of claiming much of South Africa. It appears that giving these territories to us is a way for the two big powers to avoid a conflict that could scupper the whole treaty.\n\nAgreeing to it, however, would commit us to fighting on the side of France and Italy in their quest to expand their respective empires."

It appears that the protesters had never planned to assemble and disperse peacefully. As if on an unspoken signal, the demonstrations changed course and converged upon the National Assembly. Hastily summoned riot police were able to hold the marching columns within sight of the building. On several occasions, groups charged the police line and were thrown back only with some effort.\n\nThe protesters dispersed only well after midnight. News of the riots have spread and will most likely undermine public faith in the government's ability to maintain public order."

Despite the efforts of the police to keep the demonstrations contained, small groups of anarchists and communist radicals attempted to instigate a riot. Multiple shops were ransacked and trams were overturned. Attempts by the rioters to build barricades in the Rue Royale to block access to the National Assembly were disrupted by mounted police.\n\nAs the rioters dispersed across France and the workers return to their workbenches, many in the country wonder if the government is still capable of maintaining law and order."
 lar_france_political_violence.3.t:0 "Right-Wing Riots"
 lar_france_political_violence.3.desc:1 "Following a recent government decision, monarchists and right-wing extremists from across the country have descended upon the capital with the express purpose to 'finish the work left undone in 1934', when a similar riot had failed to storm parliament but had managed to force the government to resign.\n\nAlthough the police was forewarned that the protests would likely turn violent, they were unprepared for the level of organization and aggression displayed by these well-prepared groups. In several instances, police guarding the Place de la Concorde were forced to open fire on the protestors to hold their position.\n\nWith several dozen dead and hundreds of wounded, the protestors have withdrawn from the capital to lick their wounds, but they have succeeded in showing the country that the government is not safe even in its own capital."

 lar_france_french_union.3.desc:1 "Despite all efforts by the local governments, the voters in Algeria, Morroco and Tunesia have overwhelmingly rejected the proposed French Union. Immediately following the announcement of the results, large demonstrations took place in several major cities across the area as nationalist groups capitalized on their victory to demand the immediate and full independence of their countries.\n\nThe Commander of French Forces in North Africa has sent an urgent request for reinforcements as it appears likely that some more radical elements might attempt to take matters into their own hands."

 lar_france_french_union.4.desc:1 "Following weeks of campaigning, people all across the French territories in western Africa were called to the polls to decide whether their territories should be part of the new French Union. The preliminary results show a healthy majority for the Union side. The nationalist cause appears to have been smothered in its infancy, with many independence activists now preparing to continue the struggle for more political self-determination from within the National Assembly."
 lar_france_french_union.5.t:1 "West Africa votes to leave"
 lar_france_french_union.5.desc:1 "After an intense and sometimes tumultuous campaign, it appears that the nationalist side has won the referendum on membership in the French Union in most areas of French West Africa. While the local Europeans are still trying to digest the result, leaders of local independence movements have clamored for action and proclaimed the result as a clear mandate for full independence."
 lar_france_french_union.6.t:1 "Central Africa votes to join the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.6.desc:1 "With results coming in slowly from across the huge, poorly developed region, it appears that a slim majority of voters has approved the referendum to join the new French Union. Nationalist groups have conceeded defeat, but demanded that the new state invest more into developing the region to reward the show of loyalty."
 lar_france_french_union.7.t:1 "Central Africa votes to leave"
 lar_france_french_union.7.desc:1 "Pro-Union parties across French Central Africa have suffered a series of political setbacks as one territory after another voted against joining the new French Union. With pro-independence parties celebrating victory after victory, many activists claim that French overlordship over the region has been resoundingly defeated."
 lar_france_french_union.8.t:1 "Syria votes to join the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.8.desc:1 "The French mandates of Syria and Lebanon have voted to become part of the new French Union. While many observers considered this result unlikely at best, it appears that the local population believes that membership in the French Union will guarantee access to European markets and more investment in the local economy."
 lar_france_french_union.9.t:1 "Syria votes against the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.9.desc:1 "The announcement of the results of the recent referendum on the French Union was met with loud cheers in Damascus and Beirut, as it became clear that the region had overwhelmingly voted against joining the new Union. With the main nationalist parties already declaring the referendum a vote on independence in disguise, the local military commander has sent a series of unsettling reports to the capital demanding reinforcements."
 lar_france_french_union.10.t:1 "Indochina votes to join the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.10.desc:1 "Reports coming in from Indochina indicate that the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have, with the smallest of margins, voted to become part of the new French Union. This appears to have caught even local administrators by surprise, as they immediately ordered a recount of the votes. Nationalist groups in the region have been dealt a severe blow as their morale collapsed, with many members openly wondering if they really represent the will of the people as they believe they do."
 lar_france_french_union.11.t:1 "Indochina votes against the Union"
 lar_france_french_union.11.desc:1 "The referendum results coming in from Indochina paint a grimmer picture than expected. While few in the capital believed that the nationalist hotbeds would vote to join the union, it appears that nationalist sentiments are far wider spread than previously believed. In the event, no part of the territory returned a majority to join the union. Nationalist activists are already clamoring for immediate seccession from France, even at the cost of war, believing that this is the moment to gain their national independence."

Succumbing to heart problems at a relatively early age, due to the status of his exile and the current situation in [Root.GetNameDef] it is expected that he will be buried in Rome itself.\n\nWhile Alfonso's first and second sons have renounced their rights to the throne already in 1933, and so it would seem his third son, Infante Juan, would be heir, there are rumors that the late King's second son, Infante Jaime, is considering re-affirming his succession right."
 lar_spain.77.desc2:0 "Earlier today, King Alfonso XIII died unexpectedly in Madrid, after suffering from severe chest pains. The King's body will soon be laid in state in the San Jerónimo el Real church in Madrid, allowing for the masses to pay their respects prior to the royal burial.\n\nWhile having previously renounced his succession right as a result of deafness, the King's second son Infante Jaime has been quick to re-affirm his right to the throne in the hours after his father's death. In the face of overwhelming Carlist support, it is unlikely his younger brother Infante Juan will be able to contest this claim."

We find ourselves therefore in a difficult position.\n\nMoscow has already begun making "suggestions" for appointments of ministers and officers loyal to them, and for now we cannot resist their demands without severe economic repercussions, or worse, sparking a new civil war. If we wish to obtain true independence, we must play our cards carefully and either prove our loyalty, or first undermine and dismantle Stalinist influence on our state."

Loyalist communist forces have flocked to this new zone, vowing their support to the pro-Moscow "government".\n\nThe message is clear: obey the instructions from Moscow or further punitive action is to be expected.
