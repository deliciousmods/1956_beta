 liechtenstein.1.t:0 "Death of Franz I"
 liechtenstein.1.d:0 "The people of [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] are in mourning following the untimely death of our beloved monarch, Franz I. The news of his passing has spread quickly throughout the country, and the streets are filled with people paying their respects and expressing their grief.\n\nAs our country's leader for over two decades, Franz I was a pillar of strength and stability, guiding us through some of our most challenging times. His passing leaves a void in our hearts and in our government that will not be easily filled.\n\nFranz's eldest son, Franz Josef Maria Karl, will suceed him as Franz Joseph II immediately and resume his father's duties correspondingly."
 liechtenstein.1.a:0 "Long live Franz Joseph II!"

 liechtenstein.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] suggests further cooperation"
 liechtenstein.2.d:0 "We have received a proposal from [FROM.GetNameDef] to increase military cooperation between our two countries in order to better defend our shared neutrality and independence. This is a part of a expensive foreign policy expansion pushed by [FROM.GetLeader]. According to them, they see it as a positive step towards ensuring the security and stability of our region.\n\nAs two small nations in the heart of Europe, we and [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] both face a range of potential threats from foreign powers. By working together, we can leverage our combined resources and expertise to better defend ourselves against these challenges."
 liechtenstein.2.a:0 "We will remain close to our closest neighbor."
 liechtenstein.2.b:0 "The situation is stable as it is."

 liechtenstein.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] accepts further cooperation"
 liechtenstein.3.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to increase military cooperation with us in order to better defend our shared neutrality and independence against potential foreign threats. They recognize the benefits of working together with us to ensure the security and stability of our region.\n\nUnder this new agreement, our two countries will increase joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and coordinated defense planning. We will also work to improve our communication and coordination during times of crisis or potential threat.\n\nThe [SWI.GetAdjective] government believes that this increased cooperation will help to strengthen our collective defenses against potential adversaries and demonstrate to the international community that we are capable of defending our neutrality and sovereignty."
 liechtenstein.3.a:0 "United together, we remain strong."

 liechtenstein.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] refuses further cooperation"
 liechtenstein.4.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has decided not to increase military cooperation with us in the face of potential foreign threats. While we recognize the benefits of working together with our small neighbor to ensure the security and stability of our region, the Swiss seem adamant to maintain the situation as is.\n\nAdditionally, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government believes that maintaining their own independent and sovereign status is of utmost importance and that too much cooperation with other nations could jeopardize their and our own neutrality."
 liechtenstein.4.a:0 "Dissapointing."

 liechtenstein.5.t:0 "[LIE.GetNameDefCap] suggests to reinstate cooperation"
 liechtenstein.5.d:0 "[LIE.GetNameDefCap] has proposed to reinstate military cooperation with us, citing the potential benefits of closer collaboration in the face of foreign threats. This proposal comes after a period of reduced cooperation between our two countries in the years since the Great War.\n\n[LIE.GetNonIdeologyName] believes that working together with Austria could lead to increased military readiness, improved intelligence sharing, and better coordination in times of crisis or potential threat."
 liechtenstein.5.a:0 "We have lost one, but now we'll return."
 liechtenstein.5.b:0 "That was the [AUS.GetNonIdeologyName] of old, we are not interested."

 liechtenstein.6.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] accepts further cooperation"
 liechtenstein.6.d:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to our proposal to reinstate military cooperation between our two countries. They believe that closer collaboration between our armed forces could lead to improved military readiness, better intelligence sharing, and more effective coordination in times of crisis or potential threat. The [AUS.GetAdjective]s have shown keen interest in reinstating our old treaties, perhaps as they seek to reassert their influence over us and the region."
 liechtenstein.6.a:0 "United together, we remain strong."

 liechtenstein.7.t:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] refuses further cooperation"
 liechtenstein.7.d:0 "[AUS.GetNameDefCap] has declined the proposal from Liechtenstein to reinstate military cooperation between our two countries. The [AUS.GetAdjective]s appear adamant on their current stance towords our nation, and not interested in reinstating any old treaties or other cooperation."
 liechtenstein.7.a:0 "Dissapointing."

 liechtenstein.8.t:0 "[SWI.GetNameDefCap] prepares to intervene towords us militarily"
 liechtenstein.8.d:0 "We have been informed that [SWI.GetNameDef] is preparing to intervene militarily in our small nation in order to prevent extremist parties from gaining a foothold within our politics.\n\nWe have always valued our relationship with [SWI.GetNameDef] and have worked closely with them in the past on matters of mutual concern. However, this course of action is nothing more than an act of agression that they have chosen to take such a drastic course of action without consulting us or considering the potential risks and consequences."
 liechtenstein.8.a:0 "We must prepare immediately!"

 liechtenstein.9.t:0 "Sucessful intervention in [LIE.GetNameDef]"
 liechtenstein.9.d:0 "Our military intervention in [LIE.GetNameDef] has been successful. Our armed forces were able to quickly and decisively neutralize any potential threat posed by extremist parties within the country.\n\nIt has been reported that our intervention was carried out with minimal casualties and without causing significant damage to [LIE.GetNonIdeologyName]'s infrastructure or property. We were able to restore stability and security to the country, preventing extremist elements from gaining a foothold within [LIE.GetNonIdeologyName]. Efforts are now being made to establish a new government within the nation."
 liechtenstein.9.a:0 "A job well done."

 liechtenstein.10.t:0 "Unsucessful intervention in [LIE.GetNameDef]"
 liechtenstein.10.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to successfully intervene militarily in[LIE.GetNameDef]. Our armed forces encountered unexpected resistance from local militias and were unable to neutralize the potential threat posed by extremist parties within the country. [LIE.GetNonIdeologyName] remains under the influence of extremist parties, for now."
 liechtenstein.10.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

 liechtenstein.11.t:0 "[SWI.GetNameDefCap] fails to intervene within our nation"
 liechtenstein.11.d:0 "We have put up tenacious resistance to the [SWI.GetAdjective] efforts to militarily intervene within our nation, the damage caused to them has forced them to withdraw from their positions and scrap their plans. Any interference from [SWI.GetNameDef] has been thrown back, for now."
 liechtenstein.11.a:0 "Go home Schätzli!"

 liechtenstein.12.t:0 "[SWI.GetNameDefCap] stages a sucessful intervenion within our nation"
 liechtenstein.12.d:0 "The military intervention by [SWI.GetNameDef] in the us has been successful. Their armed forces were able to quickly and decisively neutralize any potential threat posed by extremist parties within our country.\n\nThe [SWI.GetAdjective] government emphasises that this intervention is not an act of aggression and only intended to root out extremist parties within our nation. Nevertheless, they have already started the process of setting up a new government within our nation."
 liechtenstein.12.a:0 "This is alarming."

 liechtenstein.13.t:0 "[SWI.GetAdjective] remains inconclusive"
 liechtenstein.13.d:0 "The military intervention by [SWI.GetNameDef] in [LIE.GetNameDef] has been inconclusive. Despite efforts to neutralize any potential threat posed by extremist parties within the country, the situation remains unresolved."
 liechtenstein.13.a:0 "Very well."

 liechtenstein.14.t:0 "A wild guest appears"
 liechtenstein.14.d:0 "Otto von Habsburg, the current head of the Habsburg royal house and pretender to the Austro-Hungarian throne, has appeared in our country as a guest of Franz I in his residence in Vaduz castle. While Franz has stated that Otto von Habsburg is only here as a "meeting between old acquaintances" concerns have been raised that he may be using our country as a means of being closer to [AUS.GetNameDef] in the event of the restoration of the monarchy there.\n\nDespite the questionable nature of his precence within our country, his popularity amongst the population of [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] is unquestionable, thus he may be a useful figure in boosting the spirits of our people."
 liechtenstein.14.a:0 "Welcome to [LIE.GetNonIdeologyName]!"
 liechtenstein.14.b:0 "Leave him be."

 liechtenstein.15.t:0 "[LIE.GetNameDefCap] seeks to purchase [463.GetName]"
 liechtenstein.15.d:0 "Diplomats from [LIE.GetNameDefCap] have approached us wishing to purchase the territory of [463.GetName] for a hefty sum, presumably from the treasury of their newly-found wealth in the nation. They have cited that the Russians had previously intended to sell the land to them in 1867, but was instead taken from them due to diplomatic maneuvering against them.\n\n[LIE.GetNonIdeologyName] has committed themselves to a strong policy of neutrality in conflict, so we are not at any immediate risk of it being used against us should we sell it to them, and the amount their willing to pay for it may be more than it's worth in keeping in, but is it worth allowing one of the worlds smallest nations to expand more than 6000 times it's size?"
 liechtenstein.15.a:0 "If that's what they're willing."
 liechtenstein.15.b:0 "The Prince is above his head."

 liechtenstein.16.t:0 "[463.Owner.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to sell us [463.GetName]"
 liechtenstein.16.d:0 "Our generous offer to purchase [463.GetName] was met with suprising consideration from [463.Owner.GetNameDef], and after careful deliberation they have agreed to sell us the territory.\n\nWhile many have said this is a great day for the country as we have expanded over 6000 times our original size others have argued if this expansion was worth the price we needed to pay in order to secure it."
 liechtenstein.16.a:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader], the new Prince of [463.GetName]!"

 liechtenstein.17.t:0 "[463.Owner.GetNameDefCap] has refused to sell us [463.GetName]"
 liechtenstein.17.d:0 "Our generous offer to purchase [463.GetName] was met with diplomatic laughter from [463.Owner.GetNameDef], and they promptly ignored our offer and refused to sell us the territory."
 liechtenstein.17.a:0 "It's 1867 all over again."

 liechtenstein.18.t:0 "[LIE.GetNameDefCap] ceases gold trade"
 liechtenstein.18.d:0 "[LIE.GetNameDefCap] has decided to cease the gold trade agreement our two countries made previously, and we will no longer benefit from the agreement unless they decide to reinstate it once again."
 liechtenstein.18.a:0 "Very well."

 liechtenstein.19.t:0 "Landtag elections"
 liechtenstein.19.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] has announced his willingless to reduce his own power as a monarch and allow more liberal democratic insitutions to prevail in the face of turbulant times within and around our country in order to allow us to navigate through them..\n\nThe countries two main political parties, the FBP and the VU are to be the subject of national elections in order to elect the countries first national leader, with the monarchy on the side."
 liechtenstein.19.a:0 "The FBP, forever!"
 liechtenstein.19.b:0 "The VU will change the tradition."

 liechtenstein.20.t:0 "Fate of [ROOT.GetNeutralParty]"
 liechtenstein.20.d:0 "With our transition to a communist government now sucessful, we must now decide the fate of the former royal family and more importantly Prince [ROOT.GetNeutralLeader]. They have no place as an elitist society in which we are working to eradicate, but what should become of them?"
 liechtenstein.20.a:0 "Send them on their way."
 liechtenstein.20.b:0 "They must be exterminated."

 liechtenstein.21.t:0 "Franz Joseph II of Liechtenstein seeks exile"
 liechtenstein.21.d:0 "With the recent takeover of a communist government in [LIE.GetNameDef], Prince Franz Joseph II has entered our country and has formally requested asylum in and a formal status of exile in our country.\n\nAllowing a popular prince into our country may be beneficial, but it may also harm relations with the new government in [LIE.GetNonIdeologyName] itself."
 liechtenstein.21.a:0 "You will be safe here, prince."
