By wearing long clothes while access to fabric is restricted, following the [USA.GetAdjective] love for the zoot suit, or sewing a yellow star on their jacket with "Swing" or "Goi" written on it, they openly defy authority. Those jazz lovers have recently organized dancing competitions that have attracted even more young people on that path of debauchery."

But a handful of officers gathered behind the General de Gaulle to continue the fight. They struck their first success when they obtained the loyalty of Félix Eboué, colonial governor of French Equatorial Africa. A Free French government has been established as the "committee for the defense of the Empire", resolving to fight Nazism and free France from foreign occupation."
