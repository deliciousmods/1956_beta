 FRA_air_ground_cooperation:0 "Air-Ground Cooperation"

 FRA_form_the_popular_front:0 "Form the Popular Front"
 FRA_form_the_popular_front_desc:1 "With the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy, it has become clear that the infighting on the left has to stop if our cause is to survive. A broad, popular front made up of all the parties on the left will have the popular mandate to finally address the economic conditions that create fascism."
 FRA_ban_communism_desc:0 "While it is inconceivable that anyone could seriously want to visit the chaos and bloodshed of a communist revolution upon their own fatherland, it appears that there are some amongst us who would do just that. We can not allow them to conspire against the state any longer. The harshest measures must be taken."
 FRA_invite_communist_ministers:0 "Invite Communist Ministers"

We will combine these small companies to finally create companies that can compete on the world stage."
 FRA_agricultural_collectivization_desc:0 "What applies to industry applies just as much to the farmers all across France. Tiny farms can't afford modern equipment, largely working as their great-grandfathers had. By combining them into agricultural production units, we will increase efficiency and output."

 FRA_invite_anti_fascist_emigrants_desc:1 "The first step every fascist regime takes is to exile its critics and the people who could present an alternative vision of how the country could be organized.

 FRA_loyalty_to_moscow:0 "Loyalty To Moscow"
 FRA_loyalty_to_moscow_desc:0 "The model of Socialism practiced in the Soviet Union might not be perfect, but it is beyond any reasonable doubt that the Soviet Union has achieved the highest degree of implementation of socialist ideas. We would be fools to try and find our own way."
 FRA_league_of_french_bolshevist_volunteers_desc:1 "When one socialist country is under threat by a foreign invader, all socialist countries are under threat. We must not sit idly by while our comrades fight for their lives."

 FRA_host_the_german_exiles_desc:0 "Germany, the home of Marx and Engels, was once at the forefront of communist thought and practice. Many German communists fled when the Nazis took power. If we give them a home, they can help us organize a more effective government of liberated territories."
 FRA_revolution_to_the_utmost:0 "Revolution To the Utmost"

 FRA_loyalty_to_the_cause:0 "Loyalty To the Cause"
 FRA_loyalty_to_the_cause_desc:1 "Other countries may formulate their own visions of Communism, but there is no reason why we should compromise on ours. They may have stopped half-way, beset by doubt over whether the end justified the means. We won't."

 FRA_carry_the_revolution_south:0 "Carry the Revolution South"
 FRA_carry_the_revolution_south_desc:0 "The first country to fall to fascism was Italy. As a result, the ideology is firmly entrenched in Italy. Our world-views can not peacefully coexist. They know this as well as we do, and will no doubt prepare to act. So must we."

 FRA_ban_the_leagues_desc:0 "The far-right leagues have been allowed to organize unchecked. While they are currently too weak to try a coup, there is no telling of what they might be able to do in the future. Best to dissolve them now."
 FRA_the_blum_viollette_proposal:0 "The Blum-Viollette Proposal"
 FRA_the_blum_viollette_proposal_desc:1 "The citizenship of the French Republic should be open to anyone who qualifies. Many of our loyal subjects in Algeria would like to become full citizens, but are not yet allowed to do so. By making them full citizens, we would bind Algeria much closer to France."
 FRA_expand_the_citizenship:0 "Expand the Citizenship"
 FRA_expand_the_citizenship_desc:0 "It is intolerable for a republic that some of the people living on her territory would not be allowed to become her citizens, yet this state of affairs has been allowed to persist in our own. We must rectify this at once."

 FRA_join_the_ententes_desc:1 "France can not sustain two commitments of mutual defense at the same time. Unless we can get the British to agree to honor our commitments as well, we would have to choose.

 FRA_laissez_faire:0 "Laissez-Faire"
 FRA_laissez_faire_desc:0 "The Communists openly talk about remodelling the economic structure of our country in some radical way, of depriving the hard-working man of his rightful property.

 FRA_protect_the_rights_of_man_desc:0 "They may never say it openly, but it is obvious to anyone with eyes to see: curtailing the right to property is just the first step to eliminating all the rights our proud ancestors fought so hard for. We will not have it!"

 FRA_stimulate_the_dynamic_market_desc:0 "The dynamic market has been proven to be the most efficient form of economic organization. But it is still run by humans, and human beings sometimes need some reassurances that their hard work will not be in vain. By legislating away some restrictions and giving guarantees, we can help investors overcome their fears and help stimulate our economy."
 FRA_agricultural_protectionism_desc:0 "The world economy has grown more and more hostile to our traditional ways of production. If we do not take measures to protect our farmers, we will soon face a crisis of untold proportions as our farmers are unable to remain competitive in the face of mass-produced foodstuffs coming in from overseas."

 FRA_promote_entrepeneurship_desc:0 "The beating heart of a dynamic market has always been the individual who, upon seeing an opportunity, moves quickly to exploit it. In recent years, this spirit has been smothered with unnecessary regulations. We should roll them back."
 FRA_utilize_the_leagues:0 "Utilize the Leagues"
 FRA_utilize_the_leagues_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that political violence has become commonplace in France. If the country is to survive the threat of communist revolution, we must not shy away from the help of people who can and will meet the communist thugs in the street if it comes to that."

 FRA_political_unity:0 "Political Unity"
 FRA_political_unity_desc:1 "The history of France since the fall of absolutism has been a story of political infighting. When there was unity - France was victorious.
