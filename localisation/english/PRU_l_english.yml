 PRU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the death of the nationalist leader Sanchez Cerro in 1933, the Republic of Peru entered into a profound internal and external political crisis, and the chief of the armed forces, Oscar Benavides, was put in his place.\nThe great crisis that exists within the country has led the economy to a stagnation never seen before and to a severe economic crisis at the gates of the democratic elections of 1936, although it is known in some conspiracy circles that Benavides has the desire to remain in the power."
