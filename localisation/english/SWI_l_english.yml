That examination has led to the proposal of the Geistige Landesverteidigung, or Spiritual National Defence, which calls for freedom, democracy, self-determination, and a balanced government. We should accept this proposal with all haste."
 SWI_richtlinienbewegung:0 "Support the Richtlinienbewegung"
 SWI_richtlinienbewegung_desc:0 "The elites have ruined the country and with our economy crushed after the crash of 1929, have still not managed to fix our numerous problems.

 SWI_helvetia:0 "Pro-Helvetia"
 SWI_helvetia_desc:0 "While the armed defence of the nation, together with the preparation and organisation of such defence, is exclusively a matter of the state – indeed its primary duty – we wish to leave the spiritual defence of the nation primarily in the hands of the citizen. The state should have the necessary means at its disposal, and retain the right to oversee the use of these means."
 SWI_fortress:0 "Operations Order No. 12"
 SWI_heer:0 "Heer und Haus"

 SWI_go_left:0 "A Jump to the Left"
 SWI_go_left_desc:0 "In 1935 the Social Democratic Party finally renounced its call for a dictatorship of the proletariat, and cut its final ties with true communism, but now, with renewed power, perhaps its time to begin rethinking some of those old ideals?

 SWI_first_line:0 "The Line"
 SWI_first_line_desc:0 "Switzerland will not cede an inch of its territory to the greater aims of the fascists, nor be taken advantage of for strategic reasons by the French. We are our own people, and we will not allow an enemy to cross our border!"

 SWI_trade_desc:0 "The economy has finally begun to recover following the horrific crash in 1929, and we should find out what needs to be improved and what already works. Especially in terms of our trading."
 SWI_renegotiate:0 "Renegotiate Trade Deals"

 SWI_railroads:0 "Expand Electric Railways"

 SWI_shadow_seize:0 "Seize Factories"
 SWI_shadow_seize_desc:0 "War has once again come to Europe, and we cannot allow companies to sell all of their weapons overseas, we need them for ourselves. For those who refuse to comply, we have a new management team all set up for them."

 SWI_international:0 "International Relations"
 SWI_international_desc:0 "Despite our small area nad population, Switzerland is actually fairly important in world affairs. We are home to the red cross, reliably neutral, and our banks our world famous. Not capitalizing on this would be foolish."
 SWI_chemical:0 "Graubünden Chemical Plant"
 SWI_chemical_desc:0 "With our increased understanding of the natural world, we have come across great discoveries on how to create substitute fuels that drastically decrease our need for oil imports. We must make sure that we can produce as much of these synthetic materials as possible, and luckily we have a spot ready for just a factory."
 SWI_fuel_ration:0 "Fuel Rationing"
 SWI_fuel_ration_desc:0 "All non-essential citizens are no longer allowed to drive, reserves of fuel must be horded, and heating must be done using wood whenever possible. We are entirely reliant on imports for oil, and we need to reserve what we have for essential purposes only whilst we look for alternatives."
 SWI_bicycle_infantry:0 "Bicycle Infantry"
 SWI_bicycle_infantry_desc:0 "In order to avoid consuming fuel, relying on bicycle would allow some degree of mobility for our troops. We already used them to tow anti-tank weapons, so no important reform will be needed, except ensure a sufficient supply of bikes."

 SWI_corporatism:0 "Rise of Corporatism"
 SWI_corporatism_desc:0 "Switzerland has become a miserable state, unable to care for its people. That weakness lies with the weakness of our government. It must be destroyed and replaced with a more structured body, one that can effectively deal with the needs of the people and the state."
 SWI_go_ita:0 "Italian Friendship"

 SWI_end_neutral:0 "A Flexible Foreign Policy"
 SWI_end_neutral_desc:0 "For many years Switzerland has stayed stubbornly neutral, and it has served our country very well. The modern era however, does not so nicely view our continued policy, perhaps we should start looking to alternatives."

 SWI_join_germany:0 "Bow to the Reich"
 SWI_join_germany_desc:0 "Germany stands poised to bring a new order to Europe, one where our old policy of neutrality would have no part. We share many ties with the Germans, and together we shall bring about a new order, not apart."

 SWI_french_tech:0 "French Technological Cooperation"
 SWI_french_tech_desc:0 "The French did not win the Great War through pur luck. On their side were scientists and researchers. The British and French may have both developed tanks to cross the trenches, but the French were the ones whose design has become the template for so many tanks produced even now. By linking our scientists and theirs, we can protect ourselves from any future incursions through superior technology."
 SWI_extend_maginot:0 "Swiss Maginot Extension"
 SWI_extend_maginot_desc:0 "In a formal alliance with the French, we can officially join our fortifications to theirs, and using their technology, create an impenetrable defence stretching from Belgium to the Austria!"
 SWI_air_inno:0 "Foreign Air Innovations"

 SWI_army:0 "Review the Military"

 SWI_end_con_desc:0 "Until now conscription has served our country well, but times have changed and that method will no longer work. Instead, we must work towards a more modern professional army.

 SWI_con_to_army:0 "Institute a Draft"
 SWI_con_to_army_desc:0 "In order for us to have a standing army, we must first have men to serve in that army. We already have people on record as ready to serve. Well, it is time for them to serve."
 SWI_improve_con:0 "Improved Militia Training"
 SWI_improve_con_desc:0 "The army relies implicitly on the militia, and we cannot allow them to be anything but the best. Training needs to cover every possible situation so that our men can fight in any situation at any time."

 SWI_defend_homeskies:0 "Air Defence Techniques"

 SWI_interceptors:0 "Interceptors"
 SWI_interceptors_desc:0 "With the knowledge of rockets, we have come to realize the power of an aircraft that can quickly take off and fight. That it cannot go very far is not of any concern to us, for their job will be to protect the Swiss homeland from those who would dare defile it."
 SWI_other_air:0 "Alternative Aircraft"
 SWI_other_air_desc:0 "Switzerland has focused very heavily on fighters, and for the most part this is good, but we cannot forget that other plane types do exist, and looking into them, even just to check for their weaknesses, may be wise."
 SWI_naval_doc:0 "Establish Naval Doctrine"
 SWI_naval_doc_desc:0 "With no access to the sea, or even any sizeable lakes, we have had no need to actually establish any sort of Naval doctrine. However, circumstances have now changed, and we must quickly work on that which we have forgotten."
 SWI_build_docks:0 "Create a Swiss Naval Industry"
 SWI_build_docks_desc:0 "Landlocked we may have been, but we now have access to the sea! We may not have any prior planning for this, but we should not waste this opportunity!

 SWI_reform_flotilla:0 "Reform the Lake Flotilla"
 SWI_reform_flotilla_desc:0 "Up until this point, the entirety of Swiss naval thought involved only the use of brown-water boats to protect our lakes and rivers. Now everything has changed. and a naval Branch of our military has become a necessity. We must take what experienced crew members we have, and begin the creation of our own, oceangoing navy!"
 SWI_naval_catchup:0 "Foreign Naval Technology"
 SWI_naval_catchup_desc:0 "We cannot lie to ourselves, we have not prepared for the eventuality of actually having a coastline. We do not know how to build ships, and we certainly don't know how to build modern military vessels! Should we wish to compete navally, we will have to import some foreign talent and ideas, if just so we can sail on even sea levels!"
 SWI_expand_docks:0 "Expand the Dockyards"
 SWI_expand_docks_desc:0 "Now that we have created a naval industry for ourselves, the time has come for us to expand it dramatically, and bring forth the full power of Swiss engineering."
 SWI_fast_build_navy:0 "A Pressing Need for Ships"
 SWI_fast_build_navy_desc:0 "We have spent years without so much as a single naval idea, and only trade ideas for our maritime practices. We do not even have a past history of exploration by sea. Now, however, we have marched to the shore, and developed a navy of our own. We may have to play catch-up with the rest of the world, but we will be damned if we don't at the very least make a go at becoming a naval force to be reckoned with!"
 SWI_naval_air:0 "Naval Aircraft"
 SWI_naval_air_desc:0 "With a shoreline and sea access comes a concern we had not previously foreseen. The need for planes that deal with airspace over the open waters. We must tackle this problem head on, and create planes that are up to this unique challenge!"

 SWI_support_friends:0 "Support Anti-Fascism"
 SWI_support_friends_desc:0 "Fascism is a morally repugnant ideology, suited only for the dredges of humanity. We must fight with every fiber of our beings. Anyone is better than a fascist, and we will support the fight as best we are able."
 SWI_anti_communism:0 "Support Anti-Communism"
 SWI_anti_communism_desc:0 "Communism, the opiate of the clueless masses who do not understand that which they preach. We cannot allow this dangerous ideology to spread any longer. We must support those who fight against this horrid ideology, at any cost."

 SWI_secret_wunderwaffe_desc:0 "Our scientists have come forth with news that it has become possible to wield the power of creation itself, the atom, in order to create a bomb the likes of which the world has never seen.

 SWI_red_cross_tech:0 "The International Committee of the Red Cross"
 SWI_red_cross_tech_desc:0 "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is one of the world's largest and most prestigious organizations. This organization dedicates itself to treating the wounded of battle, and ensuring the humane treatment of those kept in POW camps.

Although older in design, the tank would serve not just in Switzerland, but all over the world as France's most produced tank of the Second World War."

 SWI_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Laupen 14t was one of two experimental light tank designs in Switzerland designed in 1950. Both were designed to be able to outrun larger all purpose tanks while still being able to penetrate their armor. They were likely designed as a response to the performance of the Soviet IS-3 as well as a way to update Switzerland's aging armored forces."
