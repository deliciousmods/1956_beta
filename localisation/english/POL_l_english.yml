 poland.161.d:0 "Born on December 1st, 1867 in Mierzanowo, Ignacy Mościcki was the son of a Polish landowner who had participated in the January Uprising of 1863. After studying chemistry at the Riga Technical University, he became affiliated with left-wing independence groups. He was forced to flee to London and subsequently travelled to Switzerland where he developed a patent for nitric acid production. Shortly after, he made acquaintance with Józef Piłsudski in the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). While staying in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Ignacy Mościcki became a specialist in electro-chemistry. After Piłsudski's May Coup d'État in 1926, Mościcki was elected to office of the Presidency starting on the 4th of June 1926.\n\nFollowing Piłsudski's death and the adoption of the April Constitution, controversy erupted over whether the current president had to stand for re-election under the new articles. Many predicted that if snap elections were held, Prime Minister Walery Sławek would be favored to win. President Mościcki assembled a team of lawyers and legal scholars to make a case that snap elections were unnecessary. Furthermore, he argued that the late Marshal Józef Piłsudski had given his personal blessing for Mościcki to continue the presidency. Thus the Castle political faction took its name from the Royal Castle in Warsaw which housed the embattled President."

Originally a chemist notable for his work in the nitrogen industry, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski served as the Minister of Industry and Trade from 1926 to 1930 and as the Minister of the Treasury from 1935 to 1939. Groomed by Mościcki to be a potential political successor, Kwiatkowski was the mastermind of the successful 4-year plan and the creation of the maritime seaport of Gdynia which began to reverse Poland's economic decline during the Great Depression."

Among these detractors, the Front Morges was a political alliance of centrist political parties of interwar Poland. It was founded in 1936 in the Swiss village of Morges by general Władysław Sikorski along with former Polish Prime Minister and famous composer Ignacy Paderewski.

In those most dire moments as Poland's capital found itself besieged by the Red Army, the Central Front under Rydz-Śmigły's leadership held firm in the battle of Warsaw and played in instrumental role in blocking the escape of the Red Army from encirclement.\n\nAfter the Polish-Soviet war's conclusion, Rydz-Śmigły became the Inspector General of the Polish Army in the Wilno district and later the Warsaw district. When Piłsudski launched his 1926 coup d'état, Rydz-Śmigły offered his full support. As a reward for his loyalty, Piłsudski appointed Rydz-Śmigły to Marshal Deputy of all matters concerning the East. In accordance with Piłsudski's final wishes after his passing, Rydz-Śmigły was appointed as Inspector-General of the Polish Armed Forces, the highest Polish military office."

Edward Rydz-Śmigły is now the Second Marshal of Poland. Much of the elite is bitter about the decision to recreate such a title, but grudgingly they fall in line. Although the state press declares that Marshal Rydz-Śmigły is the 'Second Man in the State after the President' as a mouthpiece of propaganda to placate the public, the truth is that the President holds little power with the Marshal now at the reigns."

Unlike Piłsudski though, Rydz-Śmigły claims that he will go all the way to ensure that the corruption of government cannot manifest itself under the guise of democratic bodies. The military, already heavily involved in government affairs, will now run the nation entirely. Although the general public is also shocked at the sudden turn of events, the state press is already drawing patriotic comparison's between Marshal Rydz-Śmigły's recent coup d'état against a corrupt elite and Józef Piłsudski's May Coup against a perceived corrupt system."

During the Polish-Soviet war in early 1920s and the German embargo against Poland in 1925, dockyard workers in Gdansk twice refused to unload supplies off of Polish ships. Such concerns over the economic security of Poland led to the impetus behind the creation of the nearby seaport of Gdynia. In 1933, the local branch of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) was elected into power. Tensions flared again over Danzig's separation from Germany and over the city's oppressive treatment of the Polish minority within its borders.\n\nIn a recent diplomatic meeting between Józef Beck, Polish 'Minister of Foreign Affairs', and Joachim von Ribbentrop, German 'Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs', a mutual consensus was finally reached. Adolf Hitler has instructed the local Nazi government to cease anti-Polish actions. In return we have promised to not support the actions of the anti-Nazi opposition in Danzig. Though the issue of the city's status remains far from settled, our recent rapprochement has yielded some positive results."

Germany agreed to recognize Poland's current borders and halt the damaging customs war that had lasted almost a decade. Józef Piłsudski correctly deduced that the French military would assume a purely defensive posture in the event of war and leave their eastern allies to their own fate. The French construction of the Maginot line starting in 1929 and subsequent French refusal to pressure Germany only reinforced his views.\n\nJózef Piłsudski, however, incorrectly believed that such a pact would eliminate the danger that Poland would be the first target of German aggression. German diplomatic efforts at the time often seemed to suggest favorability to Poland especially as a hegemonic partner against the Soviet Union. Józef Piłsudski still distrusted Hitler but thought that his Austrian ancestry would help mitigate Germany's past icy relations with Poland—contrary to what had been the previous 'Anti-Polish Prussian-sort' of politicians. An opening of trade relations followed, but such friendly offerings were secretly and purposely intended as a ruse to lure the Poles into a false sense of security."

On October 1938, German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop demanded that the Free City of Danzig be returned to Germany with the construction of a highway and railroad link through the Polish corridor to Prussia. In turn, Germany would agree to respect Poland's current borders. While the proposal for a highway link had been floated in the past between Ribbentrop and Beck, such plans were rejected by the Polish government who feared that acceptance would lead to more demands from Germany and the erosion of Poland's independence as a nation. Soon after, Adolf Hitler pressed more demands against the Polish state demanding that they accept 'German consultation on foreign policy'. The Polish government's fears became a reality."

Immediately after his death, state media praised him as a brilliant strategist, statesman, visionary, and the father of Poland's independence. School children sang songs and wrote poems commemorating the late Marshal, public rallies and celebrations were organized, statues and great artworks were erected in public places, and 'Polish Independence Day' was declared a national holiday in his honor. Public initiatives to rename streets, towns, and military regiments after his name were widespread. In 1938, the Polish parliament even went so far as to make defaming Piłsudski's name illegal. The cult surrounding Piłsudski was especially popular within the military, and the tradition continued even among the Army in Exile in the West despite Władysław Sikorski's and other detractor's objections.

State propaganda, which included adulatory songs, poetry, and almost daily revelations about his life in the press, were a means to distract the masses from the dire economic situation that beset the country and the foreign policy failings of the new regime. Poland's swift defeat in 1939 came as a thunderous shock to the public who believed that between Rydz-Śmigły's guiding hand and the help of the Western Allies, Germany would be quickly defeated."

Piłsudski envisioned the army and the cavalry as the dominant force on the future battlefield and neglected to invest heavily in the aviation branch. Edward Rydz-Śmigły saw otherwise and believed the air force would play an important role in the upcoming conflict. A large investment program in the air force and the army aviation branch soon followed. Funding for aircraft development, training, and support was increased; and with these developments, Polish doctrine was revised to envision air support as a rapid response unit for critical emergency situations rather than a scattered tactical asset."

This was soon followed by the more developed PZL P.11a and PZL P.11c which were among the most advanced fighters in the world at the time of their introduction in 1934 and 1935 respectively. With the advent of the Great Depression, budget shortcomings meant that aircraft designs had to be available for export to fund the military. Additional aircraft models such as the P.11b, P.24A, P.24B, P.24G, and PZL.43 Karaś light bomber were superior in specification but produced exclusively for export and not for Poland's own military. Hundreds of aircraft were instead sold abroad to various countries. Buyers of interwar Polish fighter aircraft and light reconnaissance bombers included Greece, Portugal, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Republican Spain, Hungary, and Romania. Even after Poland's capitulation in 1939, Polish aircraft were still operated, produced, and developed upon abroad. When operation Barbarossa began, just under half of Romania's airforce consisted of Polish planes, and the domestic IAR 80 fighter was a development of the Polish P.24E."

 poland.91.d:0 "The April Constitution's main ideologue was Walery Slawek, and its drafting would lead to controversy between the Sanation Left and the Castle faction over who would hold the position of the presidency. In its articles, the idea was introduced that the state was the common good of the citizens, and the powers of the President were greatly expanded at the expense of the Senate and Sejm. Under the new articles, the President had the power to appoint 1/3rd of senators, the Commander-in-chief of the Polish Army, the Inspector General of the Armed Forces, and held the right to dismiss parliament and veto laws that were passed 'non-constructively'.\n\nThe president also had the authority to declare a successor in the event of an emergency or war. This became the basis for the Polish Government in Exile in the West. When Ignacy Mościcki was interned in Romanian Exile as the battle for Poland still raged on, Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski, Polish general and ambassador in Rome, was named the new President of Poland. One day later, Wieniawa-Dlugoszowski would abdicate under pressure from Władysław Sikorski and pass the mantle of the Presidency to him. But elsewhere in 1944, the Soviet-backed authorities in communist Poland rejected the constitution as invalid and operated under the 1921 March Constitution."

In 1904 while the Russo-Japanese war raged on, Józef Piłsudski travelled to Tokyo to offer his assistance in organizing a Polish rebellion against Russia. Despite initial interest, such plans were rejected by the Japanese government on the insistence of Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's arch-rival, who thought such a rebellion would fail and waste Polish lives. With the creation of the newly formed Polish state after the Great War, Japan offered diplomatic cooperation and helped ethnic Poles escape from Russia and Siberia. In 1923, just after the Polish-Soviet war, a military mission was sent to Japan headed by Polish engineer, cryptologist, and military intelligence officer Jan Kowalewski. During his stay, Jan Kowalewski taught Japanese officers in Tokyo courses on radio intelligence and cryptanalysis. For his efforts, the Japanese government awarded Jan Kowalewski the 'Order of the Rising Sun'.\n\nNow we are planning to send Lieutenant Colonel Jan Kowalewski on a second military mission to Japan to offer more advanced technical assistance on code-breaking and cryptanalysis efforts.

Under Western supervision, ethnic plebiscites were to be held, and the region would be divided. Both nations agreed to accept Allied deliberations; however, with the advent of the Polish-Soviet War and the Soviet advance on Warsaw, fears were raised among the Allies that a Polish defeat would result in the region falling into Bolshevik hands. The Spa Conference in July 1920 awarded lands to Czechoslovakia that included large Polish populations but left few Czechs under Polish rule.

The Polish Army in Exile in France later reinvisioned the device as a mine detector. The final version was created by Polish Lieutenant Józef Kosacki who donated the blueprint to the British Army. The newly developed man-portable land mine detector was first used in the Battle of El Alamein where 500 detectors helped clear the way for the advance of the British Eighth Army. Over the course of the war, more than 100,000 units would be produced, and the same model would remain in service until the 1991 Gulf War."

 poland.110.d:0 "In the interwar years Poland was agriculturally self-sufficient, but her state industries and military production were dependent upon considerable foreign imports of raw materials. Thus when the Great Depression struck, countries around the world acted to quickly devalue their currencies; however, the National Bank of Poland kept the value of the Polish złoty strong. A strong currency exacerbated deflation and lowered the amount of foreign reserves available to help the economy, but provided an advantage for purchasing goods from abroad.\n\nTo make the best of the situation, the Polish government created the National Defense Fund. State assets were sold, donations were solicited from citizens living abroad, and fundraisers were setup at home to raise capital, which in turn could purchase raw materials or armaments abroad. Schools, institutions, and parishes were encouraged to donate towards goals such funding the purchase of a machine gun, an artillery piece, or even an airplane. In 1937, the War Office collected 2,330,380 złoty and 6,645 tons of scrap metal. 36 airplanes, 615 heavy machine guns, 130 light machine guns, and various other armaments too numerous to list were acquired. The submarine ORP Orzeł was also commissioned in part thanks to public funds. A presidential decree also went out that all private property was subject to requisition as a contingency in the case of war. This was followed by a second decree in 1938 which tightened state control over agriculture production and made all vehicles and livestock liable for requisition."

The stubbornness of the nationalist faction would later cause great annoyance and irritation to Piłsudski when Dmowski publicly spoke out against the inclusion of Minsk during the negotiations to end the Polish-Soviet war.\n\nIn the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the Polish delegation submitted its proposal for the theoretical borders of the newly created Polish state. This proposal was called the Dmowski Line. The Dmowski line looked westward and included all of Upper Silesia, parts of Pomeralia, and southern West Prussia. Dmowski admitted that Polish claims to Silesia were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds and on the argument that the Polish minority in the area was highly educated and thus culturally significant. Even with French backing and support, Dmowski would end up disappointed by the Treaty of Versailles which placed the Polish-German border further east than he had hoped for.

 poland.146.d:0 "Józef Piłsudski and the Sanacja government held the lofty dream of one day reforming the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite widespread support among various factions, the Lithuanian government proved to be hostile to the idea. A failed Lithuanian military coup was even launched by the Polish government in 1919 as an attempt to instate a friendly regime. But with the area now under Polish control, a new joint administration is already being formed. Across towns in Poland and in some scattered places around Lithuania, celebrations and church bells are resounding in a joyful chorus celebrating the historic moment of reunification."

 poland.147.t:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth"
 poland.147.d:0 "The idea of a Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth consisting of three equal nations originated in the 17th century when the Polish Sejm debated the creation of a Duchy of Ruthenia. Although the measure failed to pass, the idea of a three-way commonwealth emerged once again during the doomed January Uprising in 1863-1864 against the Russian Empire. The underground Polish National Government adopted the colors and insignia of all three nations. In the 20th century, Józef Piłsudski had hoped that the Kiev offensive in the Polish-Soviet war would lead the creation of a union between Poland and Ukraine as part of his Intermarium project. The capture of the city on May 7, 1920 seemed to almost realize his dreams; however, the fortune of the war turned, and thus the project was never fully realized. However, with Kiev now officially under Polish proxy, the Sanacja government can finally bring the late Piłsudski's dream into reality."

Privately, they are asking that we transfer to the African Colony of Tanzania into their possession.

 poland.158.d:0 "The BBWR coalition was originally created in part to keep National Democracy from obtaining political power. However, its recent decline and constant infighting since Józef Piłsudski's death could no longer prevent Roman Dmowski's party from riding a wave of sudden popular support for change. Decrying the recent April Constitution as undemocratic and a shameful power grab, the new nationalist coalition promises to decentralize the powers of government and usher in a new parliamentary system led by the people."
 poland.158.a:0 "Make Poland Great Again!"

 poland.159.t:0 "The Forced Polonization of Minorities"
 poland.159.d:0 "The divide between the Sanacja and Endecja movements represented a fundamental split over what constituted the Polish nation. Whereas Józef Piłsudski saw Poland as a diverse coalition of various cultures and ethnicities, Roman Dmowski's nationalists saw Poland as a nation of Poles first and foremost. When Poland was partitioned in the late 18th century, the nationalist movement arose to resist the Germanization of former western Polish lands. With academic and literary groups forming the basis of Polish resistance to outside influence, the nationalist movement in Poland thus came to encompass the more educated and middle classes in Poland.\n\n National Democracy encouraged minority groups to either assimilate or emigrate from the country. Policy platforms included the institution of mandatory education policies for Polish culture and incentives for Poles to settle within non-Polish speaking parts of the country. The influence of the nationalists led to tension and occasional race riots among various ethnic groups in the early interwar period who resented such pressure. Such scattered violence only reinforced Roman Dmowski's views that minority groups posed a threat to Poland's stability. His foreign policy aims stipulated that only territories containing significant Polish speaking populations--many residing in Germany--were worthy of acquisition."
 poland.159.a:0 "Poland is a nation of Poles."

 poland.160.t:0 "The Segregation of Minorities"
 poland.160.d:0 "With the National Radical Camp firmly in power, new government policies to mold society are underway. With increasing frequency organized gangs of supporters in uniform have begun making rounds in Polish cities smashing windows and looting minority-owned shops. Unofficially, but secretly planned by the government, non-Polish speaking people are increasingly forced to live in separate and isolated communities. Such actions are part of the government's plan to realize a specific vision of a new homogeneous Greater Poland."
 poland.160.a:0 "Separate and unequal."

 poland.165.t:0 "The Polish Socialist Party Comes to Power"
 poland.165.d:0 "After tense moments in negotiations with the Sanacja government, cheers erupted from barricades in city streets as workers celebrated the ascension of the Polish Social Party into power. After a hasty meeting, [POL.GetLeader] was chosen among the top officials of the PPS party to lead the new socialist state. Abroad, activists and leaders in the Labour and Socialist International have made public speeches in cafés across Europe offering congratulations and praise of the Polish nation's new political atmosphere."

 poland.166.t:0 "The Seizure of Foreign Assets"
 poland.166.d:0 "With the Polish Socialist Party firmly in power, a committee personally headed by [POL.GetLeader] has been created to deliberate on which factories and foreign assets should be controlled by the government. The amount of compensation offered is also determined; however, it is nonnegotiable much to the dismay of industrial leaders and capitalists. Though the initial wave of transfers is small in scale, many investors are becoming increasingly nervous about future possible state takeovers."
 poland.166.a:0 "It is for the greater good."

 poland.167.t:0 "Polish Positivism & Organic Work"
 poland.167.d:0 "After observing the disastrous result of the doomed November 1830 and January 1863 uprisings, the nationalist faction in Poland believed that attempts at violence only hindered the cause of Polish independence. The destruction of Polish property and loss of Polish lives only further eroded a culture under assault by imperial overlords. Instead, in an era of blooming Romanticism the nationalists adopted the view of organic work. Striving for work ethic, artistic contributions, and scientific discoveries were seen as the best methods of preserving Polish culture and territorial integrity. By encouraging individuals to seek out success in life, Polish culture would thus prove to be resilient at attempts to convert it.\n\nThis philosophy continued to be championed by the more moderate Polish nationalist parties in the 20th century. When Józef Piłsudski sought to organize a rebellion during the Russo-Japanese war, Roman Dmowski travelled to Japan and thwarted such plans believing it would be a waste of lives. In the Second Republic, Narodowa Demokracja sought to continue the traditions of organic work in advocating for market capitalism, investments in education, and cultural preservation."
 poland.167.a:0 "Education is the key."

 poland.168.t:0 "The Worker's Brigades of PPS"
 poland.168.d:0 "During the September invasion of Poland, various political parties in Poland organized their own independent efforts to support the war effort. Among PPS' most notable contributions were organizing the formation of volunteer worker's brigades in the defense of Warsaw. With the approval of General Walerian Czuma, PPS leaders began recruitment drives for citizens to take up shovels to help dig entrenchments and barricades around the city. Membership rapidly climbed into the thousands over the course of the siege, and their role expanded to include assisting in communications and intelligence gathering. Such was the dedication of these units that when surrender was announced, many initially refused to surrender and threatened to shoot their officers for cowardice."
 poland.168.a:0 "'Socialist Action'"

 poland.169.t:0 "Sino-Polish Ties"
 poland.169.d:0 "With a shared common enemy, Poland and Japan have long kept friendly foreign relations. In 1904 while the Russo-Japanese war raged on, Józef Piłsudski travelled to Tokyo to offer his assistance in organizing a Polish rebellion against Russia. Despite initial interest, such plans were rejected by the Japanese government on the insistence of Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's arch-rival, who thought such a rebellion would fail and waste Polish lives. With the creation of the newly formed Polish state after the Great War, Japan offered diplomatic cooperation and helped ethnic Poles escape from Russia and Siberia. In 1923, just after the Polish-Soviet war, a military mission was sent to Japan headed by Polish engineer, cryptologist, and military intelligence officer Jan Kowalewski. During his stay, Jan Kowalewski taught Japanese officers in Tokyo courses on radio intelligence and cryptanalysis. For his efforts, the Japanese government awarded Jan Kowalewski the 'Order of the Rising Sun'."

The Socialist Action militia wore navy blue uniforms and swore an oath of absolute obedience to the party. Through youth groups, trade unions, and eventual expanded membership to female units, enrollment in the organization grew to over ten thousand members. Socialist Action units trained in urban combat, sabotage, and espionage activities. As the threat of the second world war loomed, an agreement of cooperation was established with the Polish army for the Socialist Action to participate in subversive activities in support of the armed forces. Socialist Action's urban combat expertise would later form the basis for the creation of the Workers' Defense Brigades during the siege of Warsaw and then in the left-leaning resistance group, the WRN People's Guard."

 poland.197.t:0 "Strict Regulations for Military Equipment"
 poland.197.d:0 "As part of his effort to ensure the modernization of Poland's military, Marshal Rydz-Śmigły instituted strict requirements for the manufacture of ammunition. The tolerance for defects was greatly reduced but with significant trade-offs in increased production cost and time. Such high standards were intended to attract foreign buyers in order to acquire additional funds to further modernize Poland's military; however, such quality control was well above the standards of other European armies and even drew criticism from foreign advisors.\n\nSuch difference in opinion was demonstrated in one recorded meeting between Polish and French officials. Upon trying to impress French military leaders with examples of high-quality Polish weapons for potential purchase and export, the French delegation declined to buy. When pressed for further reasons why, one French officer replied 'France is simply too poor afford such weapons.' The Polish delegation left the meeting with a smug sense of superiority in their military's equipment standards while the pragmatically minded French shook their heads in disbelief."
