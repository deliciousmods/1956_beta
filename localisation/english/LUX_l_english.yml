 luxembourg.1.d:0 "While small in stature, Luxembourg has grown quite active politically in recent years, owing to the increasingly belligerent nature of her neighbours. Prime Minister Joseph Bech has argued that the lowland countries should band together, before our fates are decided for us."

 luxembourg.14.d:0 "Despite the storm clouds gathering all over the world, the politics of Luxembourg move ever onwards. The upcoming 1937 Election will see large turnouts for the Rietspartei and the Social Democrats. However, the conservative party's proposed Maulkuerfgesetz, designed to quench the growing popularity and voice of the KPL, has not proved as popular as expected. [ROOT.GetLeader] has staked the fate of the law on a referendum. The final vote for the referendum is excepted to be razor thin."

 luxembourg.200.t:0 "Trade Unions Organise"
 luxembourg.200.d:0 "Following the postponing of the National Labour Council law in december last year, the government has faced a lot of backlash from the opposition and the people. Now, trade unions have organised a strike. This issue has also united the Christian and Socialist trade unions in purpose which has lead to a large protest amassing 40 000 participants.\n\nThey demand the immediate turnover of the delay. That would result in the establishment of the National Labour Council, an arbitration organ, the legal recognition of trade unions as well as an overall increase in wages."
 luxembourg.200.a:0 "They have a point."
 luxembourg.200.b:0 "We cannot be bullied into submission."
 luxembourg.201.t:0 "The Maulkuerfgesetz Referendum"
 luxembourg.201.d:0 "Communism is a threat to Luxembourg! The Prime Minister has seen the rise of it ever since the Great War. The KPL had achieved a first electoral success in the 1934 election when they managed to get one seat in the Chamber of Deputies. Prime Minister Bech had enough and invalidated the result.\n\nIn an attempt to finally rid Luxembourg's politics of communists, Joseph Bech has pushed a new law, the Maulkuerfgesetz. It passed the Chamber of Deputies but the Prime Minister decided to hold a referendum and have the people decide on the law's fate. In a shocking turn of events, the referendum narrowly fails, stopping the law and keeping the KPL afloat.\n\nJoseph Bech has come forth and declared his resignation upon the new election. All in all, this has been a massive setback for the conservatives."
 luxembourg.201.a:0 "The people have spoken."
 luxembourg.202.t:0 "The Maulkuerfgesetz"
 luxembourg.202.d:0 "Communism is a threat to Luxembourg! The Prime Minister has seen the rise of it ever since the Great War. The KPL had achieved a first electoral success in the 1934 election when they managed to get one seat in the Chamber of Deputies. Prime Minister Bech had enough and invalidated the result.\n\nToday, Joseph Bech is again trying to weaken communism in Luxembourg. His government has proposed a law, the Maulkuerfgesetz, that would ban any party that is trying to undermine the constitution, effectively banning the KPL. The Chamber of Deputies voted in favour of the law and it is therefore enacted. But we can still hold a referendum to determine whether the people want it."
 luxembourg.202.a:0 "It must pass, to hell with democracy!"
 luxembourg.202.b:0 "We must ask the people, so prepare a referendum."
 luxembourg.210.t:0 "Elections are coming near."
 luxembourg.210.d:0 "The 1937 elections are drawing near. This election is said to decide Luxembourg's future like no other before. The continent is anything but peaceful and Luxembourg might need to give up its neutrality.\n\nNonetheless, the politicians of various parties are beginning their campaigns and touring the country. Let us see how the elections goes."
 luxembourg.210.a:0 "Prepare the Polling Stations."

 luxembourg.211.t:0 "Rietspartei wins the election!"
 luxembourg.211.d:0 "The dominance of the Rietspartei continues. It can now count another electoral success among its achievements.\nThe only minor slowdown seems to have been the failure of the Maulkuerfgesetz and the subsequent resignation of Joseph Bech.\n\nNontheless, the new government, now lead by Pierre Dupong, will be able to hope for a smooth transition of power."
 luxembourg.211.a:0 "Another conservative term."
 luxembourg.212.t:0 "Radikal-Liberal Partei wins the election!"
 luxembourg.212.d:0 "With this electoral success, the PRL finally will be the party leading the government, whereas they have only been the junion partner in past governments, such as the former Bech government.\nThe party is lead by the social-liberal Gaston Diderich who has shown to be a competent leader ever since his party line was able to dominate over the more classical liberal influences.\n\nFirst though, he is celebrating alongside with his party and we will see him be inaugurated as Prime Minister in the coming weeks."
 luxembourg.212.a:0 "The party's efforts are finally rewarded."
 luxembourg.213.t:0 "LSAP wins the election!"
 luxembourg.213.d:0 "Despite its electoral successes of the past, the social democrats of Luxembourg have never been able to lead or be part of a government. That changes with today as the LSAP gets its first ever majority in an election.\nThe party leadership has already promised to follow up on its promises from the election. If that is the case, the future seems bright for Luxembourg!"
 luxembourg.213.a:0 "A new era for the country!"
 luxembourg.214.t:0 "KPL wins the election!"
 luxembourg.214.d:0 "In an unprecedented upset, the communist party has won the recent election! Due to not even experts predicting this outcome, many people, especially among the upper classes, have either fled the country or moved their wealth abroad.\nIt is uncertain how the country will continue into the future with Charles Marx being an outspoken opponent of the monarchy."
 luxembourg.214.a:0 "The people truly have spoken."
 luxembourg.215.t:0 "Election Results Indecisive" 
 luxembourg.215.d:0 "Following the election, many people have questioned the election results. We lack certainty that they are representative of the people of Luxembourg. Only a few people can now do something, we could continue business as usual but that would result in a big public backlash. However, we could also have the Grand Duchess step in and take over the government for a while as a transitionary government. Or our large neighbours could intervene and take advantage of our situation..."

 luxembourg.225.d:0 "[LUX.GetNonIdeologyName] has just announced the successful reaffirmation of the Treaty of London, orignally signed in 1867, and the guarantee of the small country's perpetual neutrality.
