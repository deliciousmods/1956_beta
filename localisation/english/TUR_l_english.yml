The [FROM.GetAdjective] diplomats worked hard on their pitch, going into detail about the mutual histories and interests of our two nations followed by an earnest appeal to peace between brotherly nations. The back-and-forth negotiations have been pleasant, but the choice of whether we sign or not ultimately falls to us."

 turkey_hatay.1.d:0 "Following the great war, France occupied the Sanjak of Alexandretta, handing it to the Mandate of Syria. The province, now known as Hatay, has a significant Turkish population, although faint of outright majority. The debate on Hatay's status has heated up and recently, with [TUR.GetLeader] calling for Hatay's complete return to Turkey. However, large counter-protests from the province's Armenian and Alawi population have rallied against annexation by Ankara.\n\nIt is clear that Turkey takes this situation seriously, and any rejection of their demands might lead to war."
