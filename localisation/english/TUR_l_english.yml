The [FROM.GetAdjective] diplomats worked hard on their pitch, going into detail about the mutual histories and interests of our two nations followed by an earnest appeal to peace between brotherly nations. The back-and-forth negotiations have been pleasant, but the choice of whether we sign or not ultimately falls to us."

After recent elections the debate on Hatay's status has heated up and recently [TUR.GetLeader] has called for Hatay's return to Turkey. However, large counter-protests from the province's Armenian and Alawi population have rallied against any annexation by Turkey.\n\nIt is clear that Turkey takes this situation seriously, and any rejection of their demands might lead to war."
