 turkey_hatay.1.d:0 "After the great war, France occupied the Sanjak of Alexandretta and handed it over to the Mandate of Syria. The province, now known as Hatay, has a significant Turkish population, however the Turks there are not a majority. After recent elections the debate on Hatay's status has heated up and recently [TUR.GetLeader] has called for Hatay's return to Turkey. However, large counter-protests from the province's Armenian and Alawi population have rallied against any annexation by Turkey.\n\nIt is clear that Turkey takes this situation seriously, and any rejection of their demands might lead to war."
