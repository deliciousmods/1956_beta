 france.150.d:0 "Following a far-reaching call for a strike by the CGT, whose influence in recent months had reached a point where the government was forced to take increasingly drastic compromises, hundreds of thousands of workers mobilized in Paris towards the Bourbon palace, which for many reminded the riots of February 6, 1934. The latter then forced entry into parliament while in the rest of the city, defections by the army and intense violence could not be contained by the police.\n\nLed by Léon Jouhaux, the latter declared the end of the Third Republic and the transition to an anti-capitalist and trade unionist regime."
 france.150.a:0 "The workers are now in control."

 france.151.t:0 "Death of Franchet D'Espèrey"
 france.151.d:0 "Louis Félix Marie François Franchet d'Espèrey, Marshal and [FRA.GetAdjective] Head of State, passed away in the night. He was buried and given military honors before being transferred to the Invalides.\n\nThe Marshal's death was sudden for many [FRA.GetAdjective] people and the government since it had put no succession procedure in place for the time being. Thus, it urgently convened the various ministers to decide whom to appoint as a successor.\n\nFor many, the favorite choice is Henri Giraud, Minister of War and who was very close to Franchet d'Esperey throughout his military career.\n\nHowever, another candidate can stand up to Giraud. This is François Mitterand, Minister of the Interior, who, although still a simple journalist a few years ago, was able to rise through the ranks of the government at full speed, which allowed him to acquire an excellent reputation that could well work in his favor."

Many strikes have been organized in support of the front. Léon Blum, the leader of the SFIO, was appointed Prime Minister.\n\nTheir program is built around the defense of democracy, mainly through their opposition to the far-right leagues, their pacifism, and the implementation of many social reforms such as paid holidays and a desire to revive the economy by developing consumption."

Mainly united in their anti-socialism and anti-communism, their victory could also be linked to the rise of an even more extremist movement in [FRA.GetNameDef].\n\nPierre-Étienne Flandin, leader of the Democratic Republican Alliance and seen as a unifying figure for the right, was appointed Prime Minister and formed a government that included members of the main coalition parties."

 france.100.t:0 "Popular Front Wins the Election"
 france.100.d:0 "The Popular Front is the winner of the legislative election and gets the majority of the Parlement. The alliance of left-wing movements, including the French Communist Party (PCF), the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), and the Radical and Socialist Party, announces the formation of a government headed by SFIO leader Léon Blum. The [FRA.GetAdjective] hope that Blum's government will implement social reforms to end the current political crisis."
 france.100.a:0 "With the Front, everything is possible!"
 france.154.t:0 "The Right Wins the Election"
 france.154.d:0 "The various right-wing parties, mainly the Republican Federation and the Democratic Republican Alliance, won the parliamentary elections and appointed Pierre-Étienne Flandin as prime minister.\n\nTheir plan to block a new left-wing government has been successful, and they now hope to get [FRA.GetNameDef] back on its feet, mainly by putting an end to inflation."
 france.154.a:0 "[FRA.GetNameDef] shall be strong again."
 france.101.t:0 "The Hoare-Laval Pact"
 france.101.d:0 "The press has unveiled the Hoare-Laval Pact to the public eye, conducted behind their backs. France and Britain, eager to stay in good grace with Italy, have negotiated a deal with Mussolini for a quick conclusion to the Second Italo-Abyssinian War with Ethiopian concessions. This is in hopes of maintaining the nation's independence, but it has been done without their knowledge. It has caused an uproar from both the right and the left, denouncing it as appeasement to Mussolini that would leave Ethiopia as little more than a puppet state. Albert Sarraut will lead until the elections."
 france.101.a:0 "Pierre Laval must resign."
 france.102.t:0 "Leon Blum Resigns"
 france.102.d:0 "With inflation rising 46%, the imposition of the 40-hour week proved highly inefficient, as the industry had a difficult time adjusting to it. The economic confusion hindered the rearmament effort, and the rapid growth of [GER.GetAdjective] armaments forced Blum to abandon the social reform programs of the Popular Front that had counted heavily on. Léon Blum resigns, the Parlement refusing to give him the means to solve the economic crisis."
 france.102.a:0 "Edouard Daladier and the radicals will form a new government."
 france.103.t:0 "Deflation!"
 france.103.d:0 "In 1936, France recovered slowly from the economic crisis that hurt the country in 1931. The unstable political situation, the stagnation of wages, and the public deficit are already challenging for the government.\n\nUnfortunately, our reliance on the gold standard is letting deflation hamper the growth of our exports and is making it more difficult for us to fulfill our debt obligations. The current economic crisis has already caused two-thirds of our exports to collapse. With widespread capital evasion, the situation is alarming, and the disillusionment of the working class for politics is compounding our problems."
 france.103.a:0 "We must reform the economy quickly."
 FRA_deflation_tooltip:0 "§YUnlock decisions to reform the economy.\n§!"
 france.104.t:0 "Matignon Agreement"
 france.104.d:0 "After the election of the Popular Front, a massive general strike of the working class broke out. Initiated in Le Havre, accompanied by factory occupations to prevent lockouts, it quickly spread through [FRA.GetNameDef]. More than a million workers went on strike. The social movement immediately followed the electoral victory of the Popular Front to reach this position of power. The new left-wing government, headed by Léon Blum, successfully negotiated social agreements, signed at the Hôtel Matignon. All workers benefit from these agreements, which are the legal right to strike, paid vacations, 40-hour workweek, and the removal of all obstacles to union organization."
 france.104.a:0 "Let's make social reforms."
 france.104.b:0 "We can't fullfil all our promises."
 france.105.t:0 "Communists Withdraw Their Support"
 france.105.d:0 "Unhappy with the recent decisions of the left government, Maurice Thorez, leader of the French Communist Party, announced that communists quit the Popular Front and would manifest their discontentment."
 france.105.a:0 "We don't need their help to lead the nation."	
 france.106.t:0 "Communists Support the Government"
 france.106.d:0 "Unlike other nations, [FRA.GetNameDef] agreed to help the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. Blum's cabinet has decided on a policy of intervention and formalized an agreement for sending munitions and volunteer soldiers to Spain. Maurice Thorez, leader of the French Communist Party, announced that communists would support Blum's politics and strength the current Front."
 france.106.a:0 "Socialists and Communists will stand together!"	
 france.107.t:0 "Popular Front Collapses"
 france.107.d:0 "After two years of significant activity, the Popular Front lost its spirit and could only temporize as the European crisis grew worse and worse. The workers did gain substantial new rights, but a 46 percent rise in prices offset their 48 percent increase in wages. Unemployment remained high, and overall industrial production was stagnant. The Popular Front dissolved itself in autumn 1938, confronted by internal dissensions related to the Spanish Civil War, the opposition of the right-wing, and the persistent effects of the Great Depression."
 france.107.a:0 "Camille Chautemps will lead the new government."	
 france.108.t:0 "Invite [BEL.getNameDef] and [LUX.GetNameDef]"
 france.108.d:0 "To contain the possible resurgence of aggressive expansionism by the old Central Powers, [FRA.GetNameDef] has requested that [BEL.GetNameDEf] and [LUX.GetNameDef] join the Allies to stop [GER.GetLeader]'s ambitions."
 france.108.a:0 "We must protect the Benelux."
 france.108.b:0 "We don't want to make [GER.GetLeader] angry."
 france.109.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] Accepts the Alliance"
 france.109.d:0 "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] approves of our efforts and has accepted the invitation of [BEL.GetNameDef] and [LUX.GetNameDef] in the alliance."
 france.109.a:0 "Gladly, we can protect ourselves against [GER.GetNameDef]."
 france.110.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDefCap] Refuses the Alliance"
 france.110.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to offer support to the Allies, our most recent attempt to reach out to one of the nations has been met with skepticism. [ENG.GetNameDefCap] has refused to accept [BEL.GetNameDef] and [LUX.GetNameDef] into the alliance."

 worldnews.5.d:0 "France is proud to launch with great fanfare the universal exhibition of 1937. In Paris, about 101 hectares and 44 countries offer hundred-four-twenty-ten pavilions themed around the arts and techniques applied to modern life. Nearly 32 million visitors will rush to come. At the time, Paris will retain the Chaillot Palace, the Palace of discovery, and the Palais de Tokyo. The spirit and the new art triumph everywhere. The world wants to believe for a moment that the exhibition will finally bring together everything that unites men. What strikes the spirits is the monumental Russian and German pavilions facing to challenge each other: a twenty-five-meter statue of Worker and Kolkhoz Woman brandishing a sickle and a hammer opposing a giant sculpture of an eagle holding a swastika in its talons."
