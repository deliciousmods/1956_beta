MAL_centralisation_3_desc:0 "Our status as a colony means that we will always have a large amount of our resources tied up in foreign interests, but if we are to achieve any long-term financial success, the control and influence of these foreign assets need to be renegotiated back to our favour."
MAL_decentralisation:0 "Decentralization"
MAL_decentralisation_desc:0 "The real cause of our political strife lies in colonial bureaucracy and elite privileges hampering our progress, by streamlining and decentralizing authority back into the individual regions, we have a better chance of uniting the nation."
MAL_decentralisation_1:0 "Economic Reinvestment"
MAL_decentralisation_1_desc:0 "Too much of our current economy is underdeveloped, with the vast majority of our income coming from a select few businesses, reinvesting the profits of these businesses into new areas for growth will allow for us to have a much more balanced national economy, and protect against future market shifts."
MAL_decentralisation_2:0 "Break the Monopolies"

malaysia.1.desc:0 "Despite a relatively peaceful exterior, the settlements, protectorates, and native alliances that make up British Malaya are fraught with tension. Rather than a functioning state, British Malaya comprises a patchwork of various princes and resident generals, who are de-facto lead by the governor of Singapore. The result is a colony that is ready to collapse at any moment, and requires major restructuring if it is to survive the coming storm."

malaysia.2.t:0 "Malaysia Requests Naval Autonomy"
malaysia.2.desc:0 "Despite the relative distance between the home office and our Asian territories, the control over our naval presence in the region still lies in London, not Singapore. Citing the inefficiency of such an arrangement and the benefits to naval control in the region, Far East Command has requested that we transfer control of a portion of the Asian navy to British Malayan control."
malaysia.2.a:0 "A reasonable request."
malaysia.2.b:0 "Out of the question!"
