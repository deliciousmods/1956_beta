# EVENTS
malaysia.1.t:0 "The State of the Colony"
malaysia.1.desc:0 "Despite a relatively peaceful exterior, the settlements, protectorates, and native alliances that make up British Malaya are fraught with tension. Rather than a functioning state, British Malaya comprises a patchwork of various princes and resident generals, who are de-facto lead by the governor of Singapore. the result is a colony that is ready to collapse at any moment, and requires major restructuring if it is to survive the coming storm."
malaysia.1.a:0 "Let's get to work."

malaysia.2.t:0 "Malaysia Requests Naval Autonomy"
malaysia.2.desc:0 "Despite the relative distance between the home office and our Asian territories, the control over our naval presence in the region still lies in London, not Singapore. Citing the inefficiency of such an arrangement and the benefits to naval control in the region, Far East Command has requested that we transfer control of a portion of the Asian navy to British Malayan control."
malaysia.2.a:0 "A reasonable request."
malaysia.2.b:0 "Out of the question!"

malaysia.6.t:0 "The Unfederated States"
malaysia.6.desc:0 "The Unfederated States of Malaysia are a byproduct of the gradual, unplanned colonization of the Malaysian peninsula, while efforts have been made to organize these disparate groups, our attempts so far have been unsuccessful. Thus, it is time for us to make a final decision on the fate of the Unfederated States, and their future in the colony."
malaysia.6.a:0 "Fully incorporate them!"
malaysia.6.b:0 "Focus on joining them with their federated brothers."
malaysia.6.c:0 "Leave them be."

malaysia.7.t:0 "The Council of Princes"
malaysia.7.desc:0 "'Majlis Raja-Raja,' the Council of Rulers, was one of the earliest concessions granted to the newly federated Malay states, while their practical power is limited, the princes and rajas that make up the council wield tremendous influence in the region, and as such need to be dealt with before any further modernization can begin."
malaysia.7.a:0 "Strengthen their powers."
malaysia.7.b:0 "Attempt to sideline their influence."
malaysia.7.c:0 "Disband the council entirely."

malaysia.9.t:0 "The New British Malaya"
malaysia.9.desc:0 "with the final vestiges of native autonomy removed, British control over Malaysia is paramount. While this may come back to haunt us one day, for now, it allows us an unprecedented amount of control over the colony."
malaysia.9.a:0 "God Save the King!"

malaysia.10.t:0 "The Malayan Emergency"
malaysia.10.desc:0 "In response to growing fears of Japanese occupation, Malayan communist agitators have managed to storm the governor's house in Singapore, and take control of the colony. While fighting between partisans and police units have broken out throughout the other settlements, the communists have used this momentum to declare independence from us!"
malaysia.10.a:0 "Good riddance."

malaysia.15.t:0 "Malaysian Nationalist Demands"
malaysia.15.desc:0 "A coalition of princes in British Malaya have demanded the return of the Straits Settlements to princely rule. While their demands for native representation have a large popular support, it would effectively remove any control we have over mainland Malaysia, and independence would soon follow."
malaysia.15.a:0 "Perhaps they can do a better job than us."
malaysia.15.b:0 "Since when did we listen to natives?"

malaysia.16.t:0 "Britain Refuses"
malaysia.16.desc:0 "The foreign office has outright refused any concessions to native autonomy, while the situation on the ground is terse, the governor stays, for now."

malaysia.18.desc:0 "Having proved themselves a loyal subject, our government in Malaysia has asked that we grant them increased autonomy in the region, as a reward for their continued obedience. "
malaysia.18.a:0 "Very well."
malaysia.18.b:0 "They have not proven themselves yet."

malaysia.19.t:0 "Malaysia Petitions for Decolonization!"
malaysia.19.desc:0 "Having won their hard-fought freedom from the British, Malaysia has now turned its eye to us, demanding that we respect the sovereign rights of the Indonesian people and prepare for decolonization. While they do not pose much of a threat militarily, the chances of us managing to put down a native revolt with Malaysian support are less certain. How should we respond?"

malaysia.21.a:0 "They shall have it."
malaysia.21.b:0 "It's too risky."

malaysia.22.t:0 "Japan Presses Malaysian Independence"
malaysia.22.desc:0 "It appears our attempts to quell Malaysian independence have backfired, the Japanese Emperor has personally demanded that Britain recognise Malaysias independence, and has threatened to take action unless we abandon the colony. Doing so would almost assuredly let Malaysia fall into Japanese hands, but refusing might draw us into an unfavourable war, what should we do?"
malaysia.22.a:0 "We have no choice but to appease them."
