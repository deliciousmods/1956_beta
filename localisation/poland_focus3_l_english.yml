 poland.110.t:0 "The National Defense Fund"
 poland.110.d:0 "In the interwar years Poland was agriculturally self-sufficient, but her state industries and military production were dependent upon considerable foreign imports of raw materials. Thus when the Great Depression struck, countries around the world acted to quickly devalue their currencies; however, the National Bank of Poland kept the value of the Polish złoty strong. A strong currency exacerbated deflation and lowered the amount of foreign reserves available to help the economy, but provided an advantage for purchasing goods from abroad.\n\nTo make the best of the situation, the Polish government created the National Defense Fund. State assets were sold, donations were solicited from citizens living abroad, and fundraisers were setup at home to raise capital, which in turn could purchase raw materials or armaments abroad. Schools, institutions, and parishes were encouraged to donate towards goals such funding the purchase of a machine gun, an artillery piece, or even an airplane. In 1937, the War Office collected 2,330,380 złoty and 6,645 tons of scrap metal. 36 airplanes, 615 heavy machine guns, 130 light machine guns, and various other armaments too numerous to list were acquired. The submarine ORP Orzeł was also commissioned in part thanks to public funds. A presidential decree also went out that all private property was subject to requisition as a contingency in the case of war. This was followed by a second decree in 1938 which tightened state control over agriculture production and made all vehicles and livestock liable for requisition."

 poland.121.d:0 "Roman Dmowski was the Polish forgeign minister for Ignacy Jan Paderewski's government. Unlike Piłsudski who believed that Poland should endeavor to become a multinational federation, Dmowski wanted only territories containing Polish speaking people and had no interest in far eastern lands. The subborness of the nationalist faction would later cause great annoyance and irritation to Piłsudski when Dmowski publically spoke out against the inclusion of Minsk during the negoations to end the Polish-Soviet war.\n\nIn the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the Polish delegation submitted its proposal for the theoretical borders of the newly created Polish state. This proposal was called the Dmowski Line. The Dmowski line looked westward and included all of Upper Silesia, parts of Pomeralia, and southern West Prussia. Dmowski admitted that Polish claims to Silesia were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds and on the argument that the Polish minority in the area was highly educated and thus culturally significant. Even with French backing and support, Dmowski would end up disappointed by the Treaty of Versailles which placed the Polish-German border further east than he had hoped for. Out of these negotiations, Dmowski became a bitter enemy of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and accused him of accepting German and Jewish bribes to take an unfavorable stance towards Poland."
