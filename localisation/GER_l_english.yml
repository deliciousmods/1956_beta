One of the possible appointees, Hjalmar Schacht, is very good at working with Germany's companies and developing civilain infrastructure, but his lack of loyalty to the NSDAP and distain for military spending make him a worrying choice. Our second possible appointee, Walther Funk, is very loyal to the NSDAP and is a major proponent of military spending. If we are to make any good progress with German recovery, we must choose one of these two men to lead our economy."

Our current primary steel producer, Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, has been a valuable ally in the NSDAP's rise to power and is a major employer of German workers.

 r56_kill_hitler.3.desc:0 "The assistance of last night's rally in Berlin was stunned when an unknown man arrived on stage, inviting the Führer to fight him. Hitler stopped bodyguards before revealing that he was the Kung Führer and that he knew that a Kung Fu master would one day try to challenge him. The mysterious man presented himself as Brandson Lee before attacking the German Chancellor with the wrath of a tiger. The duel lasted multiple minutes. The hits where apparently so quick that it was difficult to follow the action, but suddenly the intruder planted his hand into the Führer's chest. The Führer let out a single gasp before collapsing to the ground. The SS then fired at the assassin, but he managed to dodge multiple bullets and stop others with his bare hands before escaping through a side door, chopping multiple sentries in the process."
