grl.1.t:0 "The Hull-Kauffmann agreement"
grl.1.d:0 "Denmark has fallen, but their colonial territories, Greenland remains free from German interference. Conveniently a Danish diplomat, Henrik Kauffmann has approached us regarding the Greenland situation. Acting in ‘in the Name of the King.’ He’s ready to sign over control of Greenland to us. As the officials in Nuuk would prefer American occupation instead of the Commonwealth, even though this may not be completely legal in regards to international law. We have a responsibility to protect the land and the people of the new world, including Greenland. How should we approach this?"
grl.1.a:0 "Sounds like a good idea. Put Greenland under our control immediately"
grl.1.b:0 "Let local government in Nuuk take control. Though we'll need to base our troops there."
