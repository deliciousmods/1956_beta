 CHL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Chile's recent history has been marked by government coups, civil strife and political strongmen. Though there is hope within many political circles in Chile that the country can return to democracy and political stability. This task is not an easy one for the democratic coalition who dub themselves the ‘Popular Front.’ The coalition’s rivals include the current leader and dictator of Chile Arturo Alessandri. Who wishes nothing but to see the coalition's demise. Radical trade unions seek to hijack the ‘Popular Front’ and take it into a marxist direction. While the Nacista’s facist movement gains more sympathizers by the day."

This sentiment seems to have materialized, as this morning a small amount of militant fascists lead by Jorge González von Marées tried to topple our government in a Coup d’.\n\nLuckily their movement hasn't gained any steam and the current number of Nacistas rebels is assumed to be very small.

It seems we’ve severely underestimated their movements strength, as many former military officers and some of our current junior officers have joined their cause. They have currently seized the capital Santiago and the surrounding areas. They’ve also overrun the police force and local garrisons, seizing military equipment in the process. It seems we need to not only rally the military but anti-fascist forces to crush this uprising.\n\nUnfortunately the fighting between our two forces have escalated in the last Twenty-four hours into a full blown Civil War."

 CHL_establish_the_airforce_desc:0 "Linea Aérea Nacional was established in 1932 under Carlos Ibáñez del Campo but, as yet, it is only a small fleet. The skies will prove a necessary battlefield and, as such, aircraft a necessary investment. Our military industrial complex cannot facilitate an enormous air force so we should focus on making the best use of what we have."

 CHL_expand_alliance_bol_desc:0 "We conquered Tarapacá from Bolivia after the War of the Pacific in 1904 in the Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Unfortunately, it did not result in so much friendship.

 CHL_expand_alliance_pru:0 "Return Arica to Peru"
 CHL_expand_alliance_pru_desc:0 "Arica was part of the Peruvian province of Tarapacá until 1883 when we conquered it following the War of the Pacific.
