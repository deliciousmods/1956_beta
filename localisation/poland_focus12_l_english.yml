 poland.179.t:0 "Improvements to the Enigma Machine"
 poland.179.d:0 "New security protocols have been devised for operating the enigma machine. When the original 3-rotor enigma machine was introduced, the order of the rotors would be changed every quarter of the year. Concerns over the ability to brute force solutions have led to the adoption of changing the order of rotors daily. These enhanced security features will help keep the workings of the German army, navy, airforce, and state a secret from foreign eyes."
 poland.179.a:0 "A welcome development."
 poland.179.b:0 "More is needed to crack the code."
 poland.180.t:0 "The 5-Rotor Enigma"
 poland.180.d:0 "More complex codes have been developed for operating the enigma machine. Ciphertext is generated from a series of 3 rotors in the enigma machine. Now with more advanced codes developed, operators can select a grouping of three rotors out of a total of five. These enhanced security features will help keep the workings of the German army, navy, airforce, and state a secret from foreign eyes."

 poland.180.b:0 "More is needed to crack the code."
 poland.181.t:0 "The 8-Rotor Enigma"
 poland.181.d:0 "Further improvements to the complexity encrypted messages have been developed by German cryptologists. Operators are now able to generate codes from the enigma machine using any possible choice of three rotors from a total of eight unique rotors. These enhanced security features will help keep the workings of the German army, navy, airforce, and state a secret from foreign eyes."
