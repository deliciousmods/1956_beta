 costa_rica.1.d:0 "Democracy is worth preserving. \n\n Even though many close allies of President Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno advised him to disregard the constitution and run again, he took a stand and refused to jeorpardize the fragile political system of his country, knowing that even a convincing victory would forever be tainted by the blatant disregard for democratic values. As such, León Cortés Castro decided to take up the mantle himself and run for the National Republican Party - and after a long and ardous campaign, he finally won the election with an absolute majority. \n\nThe whole election was a historical oddity with quite a few very unusual events such as the near collapse of the National Party and the rise of the Workers and Farmers Party, but the establishment of Costa Rica is just too stable to be shaken up by a single election.  \n\nCastro will be the next leader of Costa Rica, and many are already wondering if he can fill the big shoes of Oreamuno. His presidency will determine if the rise of the Workers and Farmers Party will be a mere footnote in history, or the beginning of something much bigger."

 costa_rica.2.t:0 "Calderón Elected"
 costa_rica.2.d:0 "A few weeks ago, the potential campaign of Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno has been a hot topic among the politically active citizens of Costa Rica. It was virtually ensured that he would win another term if he decided to run again, but it turned out that he had chosen to retire from politics for good instead. Oreamuno isn't a young man anymore, and spending his remaining few golden years with his wife and grandchildren was apparently more appealing than taking another dive into the sewage tank known as national politics. \n\nFortunately, the fate of Costa Rica does not rest on the shoulders of a single man. The political machine kept on chugging after his departure, and the National Republican Party quickly settled on a new candidate instead. Rafael Ángel Calderón emerged as the new leader of the party, and the results of the recent election indicate that he clearly deserves his postion. In a blowout victory, Calderón won the election with more than 80% of the vote. \n\nEven though Calderón had luck on his side - before the election, the Communist-Guanacasteca alliance fell apart and the National Party disbanded - it is still quite obvious that he is a political genius. In the next four years, he'll have to prove that he's more than a single-minded prodigy, as he will be representing the country on an international stage. Winning an election and being an effective leader require widely different skillsets, and Calderón is set to demonstrate that he possesses both."
