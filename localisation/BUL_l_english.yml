 bulgarians.1.t:0 "Bulgaria wants to sign the Tripartite!"
 bulgarians.1.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered to sign the Tripartite Pact and join the Axis in an effort to help us in our goal of world domination."
 bulgarians.1.a:0 "Let them in."
 bulgarians.1.b:0 "We don't want them in!"
 bulgarians.2.t:0 "We are allowed in!"
 bulgarians.2.d:0 "Germany has allowed us to join the Axis Powers and with that, we formalised our alliance and signed the Tripartite Pact."
 bulgarians.2.a:0 "Hurray!"
 bulgarians.3.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.3.d:0 "The gruesome Germans have declined our request to join the Axis!"
 bulgarians.3.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.4.t:0 "Romania a puppet?"
 bulgarians.4.d:0 "The Bulgarians have demanded that we join their ludicrous faction and country. They have threatened to go to war with us if we decline, however. It might be wise to consider it."
 bulgarians.4.a:0 "Hmpf, fine."
 bulgarians.4.b:0 "What! Never."
 bulgarians.5.t:0 "They accepted!"
 bulgarians.5.d:0 "The Romanians have accepted our demands to become part of our country. Now all is left is for us to decide whether we want to incorporate our former territories back into our country or to let them keep it."
 bulgarians.5.a:0 "We shall take some"
 bulgarians.5.b:0 "Let them keep it"
 bulgarians.6.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.6.d:0 "The fools declined our grand request of them becoming part of our country! We should make them pay for this!"
 bulgarians.6.a:0 "So we shall."
 bulgarians.7.t:0 "The Drama Uprising"
 bulgarians.7.d:0 "As a response to our Bulgarisation process, the Greeks have risen up and rebelled against the country. Many valiant soldiers were lost in combat against them."
 bulgarians.7.a:0 "Damn them!"
 bulgarians.8.t:0 "Declare war on Turkey?"
 bulgarians.8.d:0 "The Bulgarians have suggested that we officially go to war with Turkey in order to remove from their presence from the Balkans. The Balkans are to be Balkan only, in their view, and the Turks no longer have a place there."
 bulgarians.8.a:0 "They're right!"
 bulgarians.8.b:0 "Let's not."
 bulgarians.9.t:0 "Treaty with Bulgaria"
 bulgarians.9.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested that we support them in modernisation, and request that we aid them in researching planes for the Bulgarian airforce. This might drive them closer to us, and might be worth it in the long run."
 bulgarians.9.a:0 "What's the harm?"
 bulgarians.9.b:0 "What?! No!"
 bulgarians.10.t:0 "They agreed!"
 bulgarians.10.d:0 "The Italians agreed to help with our modernisation!"

 bulgarians.11.a:0 "Bah, filth."
 bulgarians.12.t:0 "Bulgaria to join the Comintern?"
 bulgarians.12.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested to join the Comintern. They are a socialist state now and it might be beneficial to add them to our alliance."
 bulgarians.12.a:0 "Very well"
 bulgarians.12.b:0 "They are alone"
 bulgarians.13.t:0 "They accepted!"
 bulgarians.13.d:0 "We have been accepted into the Comintern. Together, the Communist Brotherhood stands strong!"
 bulgarians.13.a:0 "Finally!"
 bulgarians.14.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.14.d:0 "We have been declined membership to the Comintern. This only makes them a target of Greater Bulgaria."
 bulgarians.14.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 bulgarians.15.t:0 "The Balkan Federation"
 bulgarians.15.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered that we join a faction with them based on our shared ideologies. It might be good, as this would prove that the Balkans can actually be united."
 bulgarians.15.a:0 "Seems fair."
 bulgarians.15.b:0 "I think not."
 bulgarians.16.t:0 "Yugoslavia agreed!"
 bulgarians.16.d:0 "Yugoslavia has agreed to our concept of a united Balkans. A Communist community in the Balkans is a great idea anyway, and anyone who says otherwise is foolish."
 bulgarians.16.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgarians.17.t:0 "Yugoslavia declined!"
 bulgarians.17.d:0 "The Yugoslavians declined our idea for a united Balkans! The fools! We should show them!"
 bulgarians.17.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.18.t:0 "Bulgaria demands Thrace!"
 bulgarians.18.d:0 "Bulgaria has demanded their old territory of Thrace. While they formerly owned it after the First Balkan War, Thrace is now obviously Greek! However, appeasement might be a good call."
 bulgarians.18.a:0 "Give it up."
 bulgarians.18.b:0 "Thrace is Greek!"
 bulgarians.19.t:0 "Greece Accepted!"
 bulgarians.19.d:0 "The Greeks have accepted our demands for Thrace. They must realise that they are an inferior power compared to us."
 bulgarians.19.a:0 "Good."
 bulgarians.20.t:0 "The Greeks Declined!"
 bulgarians.20.d:0 "The Greeks have declined our demands for territory! We should show them who has the real power here!"
 bulgarians.20.a:0 "Indeed we should."
 bulgarians.21.t:0 "Re-affirm the Entente!"
 bulgarians.21.d:0 "Per request from Bulgaria, it has been suggested that we reform the Balkan Entente, not only to include them, but also to sign several new treaties between the member states and to ensure supportive relations."
 bulgarians.21.a:0 "We agree."
 bulgarians.21.b:0 "We don't need anyone."
 bulgarians.22.t:0 "Invitation to the Entente"
 bulgarians.22.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested that we reform the Balkan Entente with them included. They made this request to Yugoslavia, and they seemingly agreed to this request, so either way they will form it. Now the question is if we want to join as well."
 bulgarians.22.a:0 "Sure, why not."
 bulgarians.22.b:0 "Let's not."
 bulgarians.23.t:0 "Yugoslavia said no!"
 bulgarians.23.d:0 "Yugoslavia has said no to our request to reform the Balkan Entente. Now I suppose this means they are no longer allied either, but we are not in an alliance with any of them either."
 bulgarians.23.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.24.t:0 "Macedonian Uprising!"
 bulgarians.24.d:0 "The Macedonians have risen up against us! Our way of dealing with them was less effective than hoped, and now they have risen up against us. We dealt with them, but it costed us manpower that's not easily replaced. However, we made sure it would not happen again."
 bulgarians.25.t:0 "An agreement proposed!"
 bulgarians.25.d:0 "The Bulgarians have proposed that some of the restrictions that were placed on them at the end of the Great War be lifted in light of their recently good behavior. They may have redeemed themselves, and they might be a usefull ally."
 bulgarians.25.a:0 "Alright, fine."
 bulgarians.25.b:0 "What, no!"
 bulgarians.26.t:0 "Greece agreed!"
 bulgarians.26.d:0 "Good news! The Greeks have agreed to lift the restrictions placed upon our country. We can now finally start preparing our country for the upcoming conflict."
 bulgarians.26.a:0 "Victory!"
 bulgarians.27.t:0 "The Greeks disagreed!"
 bulgarians.27.d:0 "The obviously disillusioned government of Greece has disagreed to our rearmament! We must act on this! If we are to prepare our country, then we shall have to stop abiding by the peace treaty."
 bulgarians.27.a:0 "Then so we shall."
 bulgarians.28.t:0 "Bulgaria demands Dobrudja"
 bulgarians.28.d:0 "Bulgaria has demanded their former territory of Dobrudja. They formerly owned this territory after the First Balkan War, but gradually lost it when the Second Balkan War kicked off. It might be wise to appease them, although if we could destroy them before they become a threat, that would be good."
 bulgarians.28.a:0 "Give it back"
 bulgarians.28.b:0 "No, it's ours!"
 bulgarians.29.t:0 "Romania agrees!"
 bulgarians.29.d:0 "Romania has agreed to give us back Dobrudja, the territory we lost after the events of the Great War. We should use this opportunity."
 bulgarians.29.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgarians.30.t:0 "Romania declined!"
 bulgarians.30.d:0 "The Romanians have declined our demand for Dobrudja! We should teach them not to oppose us!"
 bulgarians.30.a:0 "Damnation!"

 bulgarian_news.1.t:0 "The Bulgarians signed the Tripartite Pact!"
 bulgarian_news.1.d:0 "Bulgaria has signed the Tripartite Pact and with that formalised their allegiance to Germany, and are an Axis member."
 bulgarian_news.1.a:0 "Well then"
 bulgarian_news.1.b:0 "Hay!"
 bulgarian_news.1.c:0 "A toast to the Bulgarians!"
 bulgarian_news.2.t:0 "Bulgaria joins the Comintern!"

 bulgarian_news.4.t:0 "Tsar Boris III dies!"
 bulgarian_news.4.d:0 "Tsar Boris the Third of Bulgaria has tragically died from heart failure today. Formally, Simeon II, Boris' son, would take over the tsardom, but being not of age, Boris' brother, Prince Kiril of Preslav, took over command of the country."
 bulgarian_news.4.a:0 "Oh well"
 bulgarian_news.5.t:0 "Tsar Boris survives alleged assassination"
 bulgarian_news.5.d:0 "According to the Bulgarian news papers, Tsar Boris had survived an attempt of assassination, allegedly planned by Germany to dispose of the tsar."
 bulgarian_news.5.a:0 "Allegedly? Hm.."
 bulgarian_news.6.t:0 "Restrictions upon Bulgaria lifted!"
 bulgarian_news.6.d:0 "The Greek government has agreed to the rearmament of the Bulgarian military. After the Great War, Bulgaria had been limited in its military efforts and production. Bulgaria has a record of abiding to them however, which convinced the Greeks that the effects should be lifted."
 bulgarian_news.6.a:0 "If they deem it wise.."
 bulgarian_news.6.b:0 "... Yeah, thanks.."
