However, there is a way we can strengthen our people’s belief in the state. The SSS is a major Bulgarian trade union, and many of the common workers have membership or some link to the union. If we can begin to politicise this Union (that has remained largely apolitical in the past) we can gain more support and strengthen our governance of Bulgaria."
