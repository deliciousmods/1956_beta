 ukraine.1.d:0 "While the Red Army was fully mobilized to bring down the insurgency of Vlasov's white forces, Ukraine was considered of little importance and unlikely to be able to revolt as a result of the many pacifications that took place in the region.\n\nIt seems that we have underestimated the impact that the revolt had on the region, as Soviet flags have already begun to be taken down and replaced by the blue and yellow flag and an emergency government, meeting in Kiev, has unilaterally declared the recreation of the Ukrainian People's Republic.\n\nIt now seems obvious that the region can only be taken over by force."

 ukraine.2.t:0 "Peace With Ukraine"
 ukraine.2.d:0 "What was a simple insurrection has turned into a real war of independence for Ukraine. Our soldiers have been unable to secure Kiev and the Ukrainian army is now sufficiently organised to start entering territory that until then was under our control.\n\nWe cannot afford to continue a war that has already cost us so much, so we have invited the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the provisional Ukrainian government to negotiate a peace between our two nations, recognizing Ukraine's independence and transferring to them any territory they consider Ukrainian and which is in their hands."
