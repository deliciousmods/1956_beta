However, they remain on full alert and the King's cabinet has been assured that once the Venezelists and communists have properly come out of hiding the army will not hesitate to take the necessary steps to taking back control over the nation.

[TUR.GetLeader] was distraught when hearing the recount of the rally, which went off without a hitch and where Menderes announced that his official opposition party would be unveiled to the nation very soon. A string of speakers came out, each preaching the importance of religion in everyday life and in politics and every one of them generally sponsoring an ideology of traditionalist conservatism - some of the speakers even spoke in endearing terms of the long vanquished Ottoman sultanate and caliphate! Menderes himself took the stage last and spoke in much more measured terms compared to some of the speakers whose act he was following up. Menderes jovially expounded the virtues of laissez-faire liberalism to his audience, and heaped praise upon the Kemalists for all they had done for the nation before undercutting that praise with a great deal of criticism. The attendees left the rally ecstatic and confident of their chances of winning the election. \n\nThe devotedly Kemalist officer corps have approached the government and in no uncertain terms demanded that the CHP do more to curb the rising influence of Menderes and his conservative populist movement. A representative of the officer corps stated that the country's officers would never serve a Menderes government, and hinted at taking their own extreme actions should we fail to curb what they see as a fundamental threat to the Kemalist system."

Everyone was glad to have their ruler roaming the streets, and more than a few cheerfully presented the Tsar with humble gifts, from flower wreaths and local products to small wooden and iron crafts.\n\nIf this sincere and humble welcoming stirred something inside the Tsar or not is unclear, but the truth is that on this occasion, instead of private receptions and exclusive garden parties, the Tsar decided to hold a big popular feast for everyone to enjoy. Needless to say, the people of [GetDestinationName] were delighted with the idea, and everyone returned home late and really pleased after the event."

People criticized such lavish displays and blamed the upper classes for all the economic and social problems that have visited the country in recent decades.\n\nIn response, police forces were tasked with breaking up the demonstration immediately, but the use of violence only worsened the situation, and the demonstration escalated into riots."

 bftb_news.203.desc:0 "What should have been an innocuous renegotiation of a decades old treaty has instead escalated into total war between [SOV.GetNameDef] and Turkey over permissions to the Turkish Straits. \n[TUR.GetLeader] has called the breakdown of negotiations and the outbreak of war ‘unfortunate’ and something that was ‘completely avoidable’. [SOV.GetLeader], for their part, has said the invincible armies of [SOV.GetNameDef] shall stop at absolutely nothing to ensure that the old treaties of the Great War remain enforced. [SOV.GetLeader] has also promised that the liberation of [TUR.GetAdjective] workers was imminent, and that the annihilation of the current [TUR.GetAdjective] regime will be a great victory for the international communist cause."

 bftb_news.204.desc:0 "A civil war has broken out in [TUR.GetNameDef] between the ruling conservative government and the formerly reigning Kemalists. The Kemalists, who fought and secured [TUR.GetNameDef]’s independence after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, have named the current government’s numerous flagrant violations of the constitution as reason enough to topple their regime. Celebrity general and avowed Kemalist Kâzım Orbay has been elected to lead a military junta that intends to unseat the current Islamist government of [TUR.GetLeader]. \n[TUR.GetLeader] has condemned the move of the Kemalists as ill-fitting of a truly functional democratic country, and has vowed to restore the rule of law to his fractured nation. Neither side is willing to negotiate, and it remains too early to predict an outcome."

 bftb_news.205.desc:0 "Much to the entire world’s dismay, the Ottoman Sultan has been restored to his throne after a particularly brutal civil war between the country’s conservatives and its secularist Kemalists. In an absolutely extravagant ceremony that seemed straight out of the Medieval Ages, the Sultan was restored to his former position and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s republic was dissolved forever. \n\n[TUR.GetLeader] addressed his newly reborn sultanate, expressing a mix of surprise and humility that he should even be in that position: addressing the nation. The new Sultan is a mild-mannered man, but is surrounded by a court of warmongers and irredentists. Experts, who never believed the Sultan's return was even possible, are clueless as to what the future could hold."

To international observers, it would appear that Turkey has taken a more decisive stance in choosing to minimize dealings with great powers so that it can focus on regional security. \nAlthough the [TUR.GetAdjective] decision has been praised by some, it is the source of considerable consternation for others. [ITA.GetAdjective] officials in particular has reacted with some alarm, begging the [TUR.GetAdjective] government to recant their position if they wish to minimize the chance of conflict breaking out in the region.
