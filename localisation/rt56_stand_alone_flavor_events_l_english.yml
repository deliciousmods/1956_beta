r56_japan.1.desc:0 "It appears a coup d'état attempt was made by young officers of the Army. Claiming to be a “Righteous Army” they’ve killed many politicians and critics that disagreed with their overly nationalistic rhetoric. We were quick in our response and have put down this Rebellion. Many of the members of this coup are of the Kōdōha faction within our government and Army. "
