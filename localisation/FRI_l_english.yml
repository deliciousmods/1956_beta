 frenchindochina.1.d:0 "Jules Brévié, former Governor of French West Africa, was appointed by the [FRA.GetRulingParty] government as Governor General of Indochina, replacing René Robin.\nA humanist and a liberal, Brévié is very much focused on an approach to colonization that he calls "scientific", starting from a profound study of indigenous cultures and the improvement of their living conditions, as he had implemented many social reforms during the Great Depression in French Africa, subsidising Senegalese workers and setting up programmes to increase food production.\nThe victory of the Popular Front in the French elections raised great hopes among the Vietnamese in particular, with the appointment of Marius Moutet, former opponent of the repression that followed the Yen Bai mutiny as Minister of Colonies, as well as Léon Blum at the head of the government, who was also strongly opposed to colonial repression.\nBrévié has planned the implementation of social reforms similar to the one that he implemented in Africa, and the one implemented in Metropolitan France."

More than 300 of these movements have been recorded, involving hundreds of thousands of people up to the countryside where plantations are paralysed with farmers mobilizing against taxes. The result is an economy that has stopped abruptly and separatist movements that are taking advantage of it to gain popularity and spread independence ideas among the population."

The economic devastation caused by the Great Depression could very well lead to a new wave of protest."
