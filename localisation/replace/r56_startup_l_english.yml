 r56.startup.event.01.description: "Hello and Greetings from the 56 Team!\n\nPlease help us make your gameplay experience as optimal as possible by indicating if this session is for a multiplayer game or not. It really helps us balance everything and reduce suffering.\n\n§R--- IMPORTANT ---\nThis mod requires the free Poland United and Ready DLC. If you don't have that dlc activated at the moment, restart your game with that dlc activate, otherwise graphical bugs will appear.\nThis mod officially updates every month around the 7th/8th. We recommend that you finish most of your games/campaigns before those dates since our updates occasionally break save games.§! Thanks for your understanding. Additionally, keep in mind that new expansion/update releases usually delay our updates.\n\n...also, make sure to check out the Game Rules menu sometime! There is plenty of new options including "Focus Tree Selection" and more.\n\nThank you for playing our mod, and have a wonderful day!"
