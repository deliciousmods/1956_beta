r56_guerilla_warfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
r56_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "We need to greatly change how our arm forces operate. The fact of the matter is that the armies that we’d possibly go to war with greatly outmatch us. We need to adopt an asymmetrical approach to warfare if we ever hope to stand a chance."
r56_double_envelopment:0 "Sudden Envelopment"
r56_double_envelopment_desc:0 "The envelopment as a military tactic as old as warfare it’s self. We can utilize this tactic in places the enemy overextends its forces and where we have superior knowledge of the terrain. We can then quickly envelop a small number of enemy troops and destroy them before the enemy can aid the trapped troops. We can repeat this process to cut up large enemy forces into more manageable forces."
tactic_double_envelopment:0 "Sudden Envelopment"
r56_elastic_defence:0 "Elastic Defense"
r56_elastic_defence_desc:0 "Rather than focusing all strength on the front line, an elastic defense creates a 'deeper' layer of defenses which allows the defender more time to react and counter-attack while the attacker is spread out and bogged down."
r56_infiltration_assault:0 "Infiltration Assault"
r56_infiltration_assault_desc:0 "In the opening moves of an attack infantry must target weak points in the enemy line to bypass and isolate the more well-defended sections, which can then be wiped out by the rest of the attacking forces."
r56_infiltration_in_depth:0 "Deep Infiltration"
r56_infiltration_in_depth_desc:0 "Our forces are now trained to bypass and isolate enemy strongpoints to a much greater depth, ideally our assault forces should not stop until they reach the enemy's rear areas and their forces are completely cut off."
r56_backhand_blow:0 "Backhand Blow"
r56_backhand_blow_desc:0 "Rather than fighting for every inch of ground, enemy penetrations are largely avoided until they have extended themselves, at which point they can be cut off and destroyed by counterattacks."
R56_DEEP_INFILTRATION_LABEL:0 "DEEP INFILTRATION"
R56_MILITA_LABEL:0 "STRENGTHENED MILITIA"
R56_MILITA_LABEL_TT:0 "§WStrengthen our Irregular units and mobilize the whole populace to fight§!"

r56_nd_conscription:0 "Non-Discriminatory Conscription"
r56_nd_conscription_desc:0 "Even invalids and cripples must be drafted, there can be no such thing as a civilian."
r56_peoples_army:0 "People's Army"
r56_peoples_army_desc:0 "The People's Army believes in the primacy of men over weapons, with superior motivation compensating for inferior technology, and enjoys widespread support from the civilian population.\n\n"
r56_tactical_withdrawal:0 "Tactical Withdrawal"
r56_tactical_withdrawal_desc:0 "Realizing possible encirclement of our troops and preventing them with timely withdrawals can prevent the destruction of a large number of our forces."
r56_prepared_defense:0 "Prepared Defense"
r56_prepared_defense_desc:0 "More extensive systems of field fortification greatly improve a unit's defense."
R56_LAST_STAND_LABEL:0 "LAST STAND"
R56_LAST_STAND_LABEL_TT:0 "§WWhen there's no ground left to give you must dig in and make your final stand§!"
r56_pocket_defence:0 "Pocket Defense"
r56_pocket_defence_desc:0 "It is possible that, on the defensive, our troops may be caught in a pocket. In this case they must merely hold out until the inevitable counter-attack relieves them."
r56_last_stand:0 "Last Stand"
r56_last_stand_desc:0 "When there's no ground left to give you must dig in and make your final stand"
R56_BREAKOUT_LABEL:0 "BREAKOUT"
R56_BREAKOUT_LABEL_TT:0 "§WWhen the enemy finally exhausts themselves on our defence, we can then plan a counter-attack and breakout.§!"
r56_breakout:0 "Breakout"
r56_breakout_desc:0 "§WWhen the enemy finally exhausts themselves we can then plan a counter-attack and breakout from our defence.§!"
r56_breakthrough_priority:0 "Breakthrough Priority"
r56_breakthrough_priority_desc:0 "Expanding upon Operational Concentration, all needs of the front are subordinated to the need to concentrate forces for Breakthroughs. Local defeats are inconsequential compared to striking a decisive blow."
r56_operational_concentration:0 "Operational Concentration"
r56_operational_concentration_desc:0 "The key to any military action is overwhelming local superiority. Short of being overwhelmingly superior along the entire front, this involves weakening parts of your front line to concentrate troops where needed rather than trying to be strong everywhere."
