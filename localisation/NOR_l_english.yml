The company was initially established to make use of the Birkeland-Eyde process, which utilized electrical arcs for the production of nitrate components (for making fertilizers). The Birkeland-Eyde process was very energy intensive (which not few of Hydro's later industrial ventures would also turn out to be), and thus required cheap power. Luckily, Norwegian Hydroelectric power was getting abundant by then. Nevertheless this meant the process did not do too well elsewhere in the world, and eventually the company switched to less energy intensive methods. In 1927 the switch was made to the Haber-Bosch process in cooperation with the chemical giant IG Farben.\n\nNorsk Hydro's facilities in Rjukan and Notodden now produced liquid ammonia, which was then transported to their new facilities at Herøya for production of Calcium Nitrate, which thus became known as Norwegian saltpeter. Now Norsk Hydro is expanding into new fields; in 1934 the world's first commercial heavy water facility was built at Vemork, producing industrial quantities of this new commodity.\n"

The innovative and efficient production methods allowed the local foundry to become a large and respected factory in a matter of less than three decades.\n\nWith expanded markets, the Oslo-based factory eventually began producing tools and other iron-based goods as well. During the Great War and the 1920s they even expanded their operations with domestic smelters.\n"

In Norway, however, he holds no such formal titles, as aristocracy was discontinued with the Nobility Law of 1821. As a skilled diplomat, Wedel played a central role in the Norwegian aquisition of the Svalbard archipelago.

 naw_norway.31.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses to submit to us"
 naw_norway.31.d:0 "The Finnish have decided to refuse our generous offer of submitting to us and keeping their autonomy. Apparently they'd rather be partitioned between us and the Soviets, and apparently hard liquors are way too easy to come by for Finnish statesmen. Now it is our turn to decide; is spreading the revolution to the Finnish people worth a war?"

 naw_norway.32.d:0 "The Norwegian leaders have decided to side with Germany to dissuade attacks by them. Naturally many Danes are now upset as we gave up our islands in the North Atlantic in exchange for support to retake all of Slesvig, and maybe Holsten too. And what is more, if Germany defeats the other major powers, how will we be able to defend against them then? We're even on their border... At the very least we could issue our complaints to the Norwegians to satisfy our public and maybe get something out of it?"

 naw_norway.34.t:0 "[From.GetName] issues complaints against us taking sides with Germany"
 naw_norway.34.d:0 "The Danish leaders seemed pretty miffed that we sided with Germany. First there's the issue of how we promised to help reclaiming Slesvig, then there's the fact that the Germans might come for us and the current Danish part of Slesvig if they grow stronger, despite us taking sides. How shall we deal with this?"
 naw_norway.34.a:0 "They must be compensated! Monetary compensation and Greenland as a collateral."
 naw_norway.34.b:0 "Relinquish Greenland back to them as a collateral for now."
 naw_norway.34.c:0 "The fools! Do they not understand that we had to do this? They get nothing."
 
 naw_norway.35.t:0 "The Norwegians agree to massive compensations"
 naw_norway.35.d:0 "It would seem the Norwegians have really understood our complaints. They've relinquished Greenland back to us as a temporary collateral, in addition to giving us massive monetary compensation, which we're now redirecting into our industries."
 naw_norway.35.a:0 "It's only right that they pay up, but thanks."
 
 naw_norway.36.t:0 "The Norwegians hand over Greenland"
 naw_norway.36.d:0 "For the time being the Norwegians have handed Greenland back to us as a collateral until the rest of Slesvig is ours. We didn't win the Greenland case for nothing! And our public is soothed for now."
 naw_norway.36.a:0 "Acceptable."
 
 naw_norway.37.t:0 "The Norwegians have denied us compensation"
 naw_norway.37.d:0 "Claiming they did what was necessary, the Norwegians have denied us compensation, saying siding with Germany was necessary for the survival of all our nations. This will not be easy to smooth over for us, but such a move and their lacking will to compromise have surely damaged the Norwegian politicians' credibility even more."
 naw_norway.37.a:0 "This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals."
 
 naw_norway.38.t:0 "Upholding our end of the bargain"
 naw_norway.38.d:0 "Slesvig-Holsten is ours, and the Norwegians have upheld their end of the bargain. Measures are now being taken to hand Greenland back to them once more, as was our part of the deal."
 naw_norway.38.a:0 "Take good care of the Inuit, now!"
 
 naw_norway.39.t:0 "[From.GetName] has handed Greenland back to us"
 naw_norway.39.d:0 "The Danes, recognizing that our end of the bargain with helping them reclaim Slesvig has been fulfilled, have handed Greenland back to us once more. No longer a temporary collateral, Greenland is now part of the Norwegian Kingdom, and the Inuit will become Norwegian citizens."
 naw_norway.39.a:0 "Wonderful. How often do you see a string of events with a moral to it?"
 
 naw_norway.40.t:0 "[From.GetName] sides with the Russians after promising Karelia to us"
 naw_norway.40.d:0 "The Norwegian leaders have decided to side with the Russians to dissuade attacks by them. Naturally some Finns are now upset that we gave up our islands in the Baltic in exchange for support to retake Karelia and end the eastern threat. And what is more, if the Russians defeat the other major powers, how will we be able to defend against them then? We share a huge border with them! At the very least we could issue our complaints to the Norwegians to satisfy our public and maybe get something out of it?"

 naw_norway.41.t:0 "[From.GetName] understands our decision to side with Russia"
 naw_norway.41.d:0 "The Finns, while upset because we promised them help with retaking Karelia, but probably more so because we sided with a threat that may one day come for them, understands our pragmatism in siding with Russia.

 naw_norway.42.d:0 "The Finnish leaders seemed pretty miffed that we sided with the Russians. First there's the issue of how we promised to help reclaiming the rest of Karelia, then there's the fact that the Soviets might come for us and Finland if they grow stronger, despite us taking their side. That's the belief of the Finns anyway. How shall we deal with this?"
 naw_norway.42.a:0 "They must be compensated! Give them monetary compensation."

 naw_norway.50.d:0 "After Norway was separated from the Danish Kingdom in 1814, the treaty of Kiel gave us possession of their former North Atlantic islands, Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroes. While there has been disagreements on this with the temporary occupation of eastern Greenland by Norwegian irredentists, the Norwegians have now come to us diplomatically, albeit with different demands.\n\nIn return for transferring their former islands of the Faroes and Iceland back to them, the Norwegians will drop their claims on Greenland, defend us in the case of an attack from the Germans, and also help negotiate the return of Slesvig and parts of Holsten should the opportunity arrise. While the demands are quite extensive, the North Atlantic Islands are not the most economically important area of our country, and a return of Slesvig would have proven much more profitable. Should we accept or reject this proposal, or mayhaps propose a compromise, seeing the demands are quite extensive?"
 naw_norway.50.a:0 "Accept, and throw in Greenland as well. We should befriend our kindred people in the North at any cost!
 naw_norway.50.b:0 "Accept. The islands were Norwegian, and Slesvig-Holsten would be of more value to us."

 naw_norway.52.d:0 "While the Danes liked the general idea of the deal, they unsurprisingly found it a little too one side, seeing as we're the only ones who see immediate gains from it. They've thus proposed a seemingly reasonable counteroffer where the deal is modified so they keep Iceland. Our foreign dignitaries found this reasonable enough and accepted the modified deal."
 naw_norway.52.a:0 "Not perfect, but perfectly acceptable."
 
 naw_norway.53.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects the Deal"
 naw_norway.53.d:0 "Citing no immediate gains for [From.GetName] and excessive demands from us, the Danes have rejected our plea to reaquire our islands for support in retaking Slesvig-Holsten. While this is a significant setback for our diplomatic path to increased influence, we play this the risky way and instigate revolts on Iceland and the Faroes, seeing as the inhabitants were originally from the Norwegian mainland and part of our Kingdom. This would risk our alliance with Denmark though, and if Denmark doesn't back down, war may break out..."

Utilizing the growing nationalist and autonomy movements on the islands, as well as their common cultural and ethnic ties, the Norwegians have sent troublemakers to the Islands and had them join their country. Greenland remains safe as the inhabitants there do not have such extensive ties to Norway, but we need to take a stance here. Should we accept the previous deal, accept status quo, or leave the alliance and take back our islands by force?"
 naw_norway.54.a:0 "Toss in Greenland as well, we might as well save the initial deal and have them support in retaking Slesvig."

 naw_norway.55.d:0 "The revolt instigations have been a total success. The Danes have folded to salvage the intial deal, not wanting to risk war, and seeing as the supply lines to Greenland were to long to be worth maintaining. Since the intial deal was pretty largely in our favour, we should forgive their transgressions and support their right to Slesvig if it's ever a relevant issue."

 naw_norway.57.t:0 "[From.GetName] declares War on us!"

Citing the island revolts as unlawful Norwegian meddling, the Danes have declared it an act of war and have subsequently mobilized their forces against us and declared war. The only positive in this is that the Danes took the first offensive moves, and this could potentially help convince other allied states to join our defense against the Danish."

The treaty of Kiel took this island away from us, with us having little say in the matter. And the Greenland case did not work out well for us either... Now, however, fate has brought it back to us. While the new settlers of this island, the Inuit people, have been Christened and integrated, they're not originally of Norwegian ancestry like the Faroese and Icelandic peoples, so integration has naturally been harder here.

Should we use modern Norwegian written language, or something based on our other less common written language, but which is more traditional, and conforms to both the dialects of the Jamtlanders themselves and our bordering region of Trøndelag? There's also the back to our roots approach where we give it its old norse name."

In a modern way, a traditional way, or a very traditional way?"
 naw_norway.85.a:0 "Modern bokmål will do nicely. With the samnorsk initiatives, it's Norwegian enough."

Could they have been forced or pressured into admitting this? Is the General Secretary attempting to get rid of political opponents?\n\nAs news are brought back to Norway, media and people have speculated on what is going on, and often condemned the trials as unjust and suspect.

Though this time without rule from Copenhagen or Stockholm.\n\nThe traditional conservative, centrist, agrarian and monarchist elements have now joined forces with much of the Military to attempt to restore such a state.

 ####--Leader Descriptions--####
 POLITICS_JOHAN_NYGAARDSVOLD_DESC:0 "Born a farmer's son in Hommelvik, in what is now Malvik municipality, Johan Nygaardsvold had his first job at a sawmill at 12 years of age. He emigrated to Canada, and later the United States, as a young adult in 1902. There he took jobs in British Columbia, Montana and Washington.\n\nWhen he returned to Norway just five years later, he got into poltics to stay, and in 1910 he was elected to the board of education for the Labour Party, which he would continue to represent. Now he has already made his mark on Norwegian politics, being one of the people behind the so-called \"crisis accord\" with the Farmers' Party, which allowed him to form a Government in 1935, as was asked of him. His Government has been a large proponent of alleviating the effects of the Depression through progressive welfare policies, but maybe not so much of military spending and vigilant foreign policies."
 POLITICS_NILS_TRAEDAL_DESC:0 "Born a farmer's son in Sunndal, Nils Trædal has had plenty of responsibility and political experience throughout his life. The jobs and leadership roles held in his adult life include working as; a priest, a politician, a former mayor, a former Church and Education minister of both Peder L. Kolstad's Government and Jens Hundeid's Government (1931-1932 and 1932-1933, respectively), an acting Prime Minister/Foreign Minister (early 1932), a Government representative of Møre og Romsdal county, and a former member of the Liberal Party.\n\nHe was also a co-founder of the Farmers' Party's predecessor, and he has now risen to become the party leader of the current Farmers' Party. An advocate for agricultural reform and a man of many talents, Norway can now enjoy the benefits of his varied experience."
 POLITICS_IVAR_LYKKE_DESC:0 "Born in what was then called Trondhjem, Ivar Lykke was the son of a grocer and businessman. After he had worked in his father's business, his introduction to politics first came as he represented the trade industries in local politics. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1916, and was noted as a moderate and sober politician, representing the interests of practical businesses.\n\nHis acceptance of social liberal reforms, as well as his pleasant and humble demeanor, earned him much trust throughout the years. He turned down his first opportunity to become Prime Minister, but in 1926 his namesake Government formed, and this time with him as the Prime Minister of Norway. After this he has continued his work in politics, an example being the naming dispute of his home city, Trondhjem. The question was of whether it was to still be called Trondhjem or reverted to old Norwegian Nidaros. In March of 1931 it ended on Lykke's compromise suggestion, Trondheim."
 POLITICS_CARL_JOACHIM_HAMBRO_DESC:0 "Born in 1885, and a native to Bergen, for most of his adult life he's been a journalist and an editor-in-chief for Morgenbladet (the country's first daily newspaper). Unsurprisingly he's also a skilled rhetorician, and since 1919 he's been an elected offical to Norway's National Assembly and Supreme Legislature, Stortinget. Since then he's held important positions such as the Parliamentary Leader of Høyre, President of the Storting and Vice President of the Storting.\n\nA merited man, having been awarded the Grand Cross of St. Olav's Order in 1937, and a knowledgable man, on literature both old and new, Hambro can get things done right (and swiftly when needed)."
 POLITICS_JOHAN_LUDWIG_MOWINCKEL_DESC:0 "Johan Ludwig Mowinckel was born in Bergen in 1870, born into one of Norway's oldest shopkeeping families. He studied language and business abroad, in Germany, England and France. He bought his first boat in 1898, and ran a shipping company in his own name. Shortly thereafter he got into the city council of Bergen, and he was the mayor during the dissolution of the Union between Norway and Sweden. In 1907 he took office in the Norwegian Parliament for the first time.\n\nSince then Johan L. Mowinckel would later go on to be part of several Governments, serving as Prime Minister thrice, and often holding other important positions such as President of the Storting (the Norwegian Parliament), Minister of Industry, Minister of Commerce, and Foreign Minister, among other postitions. He's truly an important figure in Norwegian politics."
 POLITICS_HAAKON_VII_DESC:0 "King Haakon VII was actually born Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel, prince of Denmark and Iceland, in 1872. In his younger life he served in the Danish Navy, from 1893 with the rank of lieutenant. He got married to the British Princess Maud (whom the Norwegian Antarctic territories are named after) in Buckingham Palace in 1896. Since then Carl (the name he mostly used) and Maud travelled between Denmark and Great Britain.\n\nThe lifestyle of the couple would change drastically when Norwegian politicians approached Prince Carl with an offer to become the King of independent Norway as the Union between Norway and Sweden dissolved. The 18th of November 1905, Prince Carl announced through telegram that he would take the name Haakon VII, and that his son and heir (Alexander) would be given the name Olav. The 25th of November he arrived in Norway, and the 27th he took the Oath as Norway's first independent King in 518 years.\n\nNow through some unprecedented further changes towards the traditional, the democratically minded Haakon finds himself as a more absolute and traditional King than ever before. What kind of madman could be behind this development?"
 POLITICS_VIDKUN_QUISLING_DESC:0 "A native of Fyresdal, young Vidkun Quisling was a talented student of humanities, history and natural sciences. In 1905 he enrolled in the Norwegian Military Academy, receiving the highest entrance examination score of the 250 applicants of that particular year. He did so well in his studies he earned an audience with the King, and he later went on to serve as an officer. During the Great War he detested the peace sentiment, but moderated his views after noting the enormous human costs of the war.\n\nSince then he served as an attaché, he served as the military's expert on Russian affairs, he helped Fridtjof Nansen organize humanitarian relief efforts following the Great War, he got married twice, he flirted with the Norwegian communist movement (no doubt inspired by the effective People's Militias of the Soviet Union), he served as the Defense Minister in Peder Kolstad's Agrarian Government (despite being neither an agrarian nor Kolstad's friend, but his experience and knowledge were undeniable), and finally he helped form the political party \"Nasjonal Samling\" out of the former political movement \"Nordisk folkereisning i Norge\". Now he finally represents a party that follows his own political views, a distinct mix of nationalism and socialism."
 POLITICS_ADAM_EGEDE_NISSEN_DESC:0 "Adam Hjalmar Egede-Nissen was born on a farm in Frol municipality. In his younger years he studied philosophy while working in the postal service, eventually becoming the head of the local distribution center of Vardø in 1897, near the Russian border. In 1900 his political career brought him into the Norwegian Parliament for the first time as a representative of the Liberal Party, Venstre. In 1905 he switched his political allegiance to the Labour Party, where he turned down another period in the Parliament in 1912 in favour of continued work for the Norwegian postal service.\n\nWhile holding experience both with regular jobs and politics, Egede-Nissen was no stranger to more radical approaches to getting things done either, having illegally smuggled and printed revolutionary literature, as well as formed a radical Miner's Union in 1906. His time in Vardø gave him insight into the growing revolutionary sentiment in Russia, which he's since supported to quite a large degree. He was the mayor of Stavanger from 1915 to 1919, during which he was fined for his involvement in the 1919 general strike in support of the Russian revolution. In 1918 he had also went to Russia and met with Lenin, while also attending a meeting dedicated to the formation of the now well known Comintern. When the Labour Party split in 1923, Egede-Nissen followed the more radical politicians and joined the Norwegian Communist Party, NKP."

 NOR_lords_of_the_isles_propaganda_aberdeenshire_desc:0 "By promoting not only Norse-Gaelic ties, but also Highlander ties, we could integrate the Highlanders of Aberdeenshire into our satellite state, [LOI.GetNameDef].
