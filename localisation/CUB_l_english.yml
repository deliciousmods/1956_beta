 cuba.1.d:0 "It is now time for the Cuban people to be called to the polls to elect their leader.\nThis year, two main forces are present, the first being the Tripartite coalition, composed of the Liberal Party, National Unity and Republican Action. The latter has the support of the many forces behind the 1933 revolution, in particular General Fulgencio Batista.\nAgainst them, the rather conservative national democratic association, led by former President Mario García Menocal, who had led Cuba in particular during the First World War."

 cuba.3.t:0 "Mario García Menocal's Inauguration"
 cuba.3.d:0 "Mario García Menocal was inaugurated as the seventh president of Cuba, following his party's victory in the election earlier this year.\nHaving already been president from 1913 to 1921, he represented for many the former republic before the 1933 revolution. Despite his reforms during his first presidency, he was re-elected on an opposition to the left coalition, and consequently to the personalities behind the 1933 coup, bringing him closer to both conservative and anti-labour circles.\nOne of his other concerns will be the army, still led by Fulgencio Batista, one of the instigators of the 1933 revolution."

 cuba.6.t:0 "Cuba Suggests A War against Spain"
 cuba.6.d:0 "Declaring that the apparent neutrality that the Spanish regime is trying to show is in reality only a façade hiding secret aid to the war effort, the Cuban government has suggested a declaration of war against fascist Spain.\n\nSuch a declaration is not made lightly, especially against a country that is currently neutral. There is little doubt, however, that Spain's support is oriented towards the forces of the axis."
