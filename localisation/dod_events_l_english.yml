 DOD_hungary.1.t:0 "Hungary demands a referendum"
 DOD_hungary.1.desc:0 "in a speech in Budapest, [HUN.GetLeader] has demanded that his Austrian subjects be permitted to return to his rule. In a gesture of reconciliation, however, he has publicly noted that the Austrian people should be permitted to make that choice for themselves."
 DOD_hungary.1.a:0 "Let the people have their say."
 DOD_hungary.1.b:0 "Such things should be left to professionals."
 DOD_hungary.1.c:0 "We will ensure the right results."
 DOD_hungary.2.t:0 "Referendum approved"
 DOD_hungary.2.desc:0 "The results of the Referendum are in, and the preliminary count shows a significant majority for Union with Hungary."
 DOD_hungary.2.a:0 "The people have spoken."
 DOD_hungary.3.t:0 "Referendum fails"
 DOD_hungary.3.desc:0 "Despite a well-orchestrated campaign by pro-Hungarian groups and monarchists, preliminary results show a small majority for maintaining the status quo."
 DOD_hungary.3.a:0 "Wise choice."
 DOD_hungary.4.t:0 "Referendum succeeds"
 DOD_hungary.4.desc:0 "Shortly after midnight, [AUS.GetLeader] announced that the Austrian people had voted for a union with Hungary. A telegram has arrived, formally offering [HUN.GetLeader] the crown of Austria in a first step to revive the double monarchy."
 DOD_hungary.4.a:0 "Excellent."
 DOD_hungary.5.t:0 "Referendum defeated"
 DOD_hungary.5.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the people of Austria have decided to keep the status quo."
 DOD_hungary.5.a:0 "We must liberate the country and return it to its rightful ruler."
 DOD_hungary.5.b:0 "We shall respect the result."
 DOD_hungary.6.t:0 "Referendum refused"
 DOD_hungary.6.desc:0 "Austrian leader [AUS.GetLeader] has publicly declared that the entire country is united in their opposition to the Habsburgs, and that the very idea of a referendum on Austrian independence is utterly absurd. "
 DOD_hungary.6.a:0 "We shall see how united they really are."
 DOD_hungary.6.b:0 ""Democracy" at work."
 DOD_hungary.7.t:0 "Guiding the referendum"
 DOD_hungary.7.desc:0 "The Hungarian offer of a referendum has put us in a tight spot internationally. We can't be seen to deny the people a choice, but we can't trust them to make the right one. Thankfully, there are ways and means to solve the issue. What result do we want from the referendum?"
 DOD_hungary.7.a:0 "People refuse"
 DOD_hungary.7.b:0 "People agree"
 DOD_hungary.10.t:0 "Austria-Hungary offers Guarantees"
 DOD_hungary.10.desc:0 "With the recent, dramatic shifts in the political landscape of the Balkans, the question of our relationship with the new Austro-Hungarian Empire has come up repeatedly. Today, the Hungarian ambassador has handed over an official note, formally requesting that we declare our position towards the Empire. The Habsburgs claim that, as old crown lands, Bohemia and Moravia belong to them. \n\nHowever, [HUN.GetLeader] has indicated that he would accept a compromise solution, with himself nominally head of state of our country, but with very little real power."
 DOD_hungary.10.a:0 "We shall return to the Empire."
 DOD_hungary.10.b:0 "We shall accept the compromise."
 DOD_hungary.10.c:0 "We will never give up our freedom for safety!"
 DOD_hungary.11.t:0 "Bohemia returns to the crown"
 DOD_hungary.11.desc:0 "Following discussion at the highest level that ran late into the night, the [CZE.GetAdjective] government has decided to accept our offer and proclaimed [HUN.GetLeader] the King of Bohemia and Margrave of Moravia. The soldiers of the former Czech Army have sworn an oath to their new King and Emperor, and the civil administration of the realms has been fully integrated."
 DOD_hungary.11.a:0 "Another step on the way to reclaim our birthright."
 DOD_hungary.12.t:0 "Bohemia agrees to closer relationship"
 DOD_hungary.12.desc:0 "Treading a careful balance between the republican and the monarchist factions in his government, [CZE.GetLeader] has opted for a compromise solution. [HUN.GetLeader] will be declared King of Bohemia and Moravia, but the [CZE.GetAdjective] constitution will limit his powers to only act with the advice and consent of parliament."
 DOD_hungary.12.a:0 "Acceptable."
 DOD_hungary.13.t:0 "[CZE.GetNameDefCap] refuses advances"
 DOD_hungary.13.desc:0 "[CZE.GetNameDefCap] has refused to entertain any kind of settlement or agreement concerning their future relationship with us. When our ambassador arrived at the foreign office to discuss the official note he had delivered earlier, he was told that there was nothing to talk about, and quickly shown out the door. The [CZE.GetAdjective] ambassador to our government has declared that, while his government wants a peaceful and friendly relationship between our nations, there is no possibility of incorporating [CZE.GetNameDef] into the Austro-Hungarian Empire."
 DOD_hungary.13.a:0 "That is unfortunate."
 DOD_hungary.20.t:0 "The war in Hungary"
 DOD_hungary.20.desc:0 "Following the outbreak of war in Hungary, the question of supporting them has come up repeatedly. Conservative newspapers have clamored for action to help the Hungarians, claiming that the King can not reasonably be expected to sit idle while his own son, now the King of Hungary, is under attack. A letter by an anonymous group of Army officers has been leaked to the press, stating that a large number of soldiers would be willing to go to Hungary to fight, if the government would let them. \n\nThe government has met to discuss a number of options."
 DOD_hungary.20.a:0 "We can't afford to be drawn into this conflict."
 DOD_hungary.20.b:0 "Send an observer mission to Hungary. Make it big."
 DOD_hungary.20.c:0 "Their war is our war."
 DOD_hungary.21.t:0 "Sweden refuses aid."
 DOD_hungary.21.desc:0 "Despite multiple appeals from both the Swedish king and elements of the Swedish military, the government of Sweden has refused to allow anyone to come to our aid. Even private individuals who wish to travel to Hungary to fight are refused traveling visas, and the government has pushed through legislation making it illegal to sell guns to us."
 DOD_hungary.21.a:0 "We are on our own."
 DOD_hungary.22.t:0 "Sweden sends support"
 DOD_hungary.22.desc:0 "While the Swedish government is officially neutral, it has allowed a surprisingly large number of soldiers and officers to go on extended leaves of absence and even allowed them to take their personal weapons with them. The soldiers have made their way to Hungary and are now ready to join our military."
 DOD_hungary.22.a:0 "Excellent."
 DOD_hungary.23.t:0 "Sweden intervenes"
 DOD_hungary.23.desc:0 "In a development surprising even experienced diplomats, the Swedish government has announced that they consider our survival to be a core national interest of Sweden. Rumor has it that the Swedish King himself has intervened on our behalf, threatening to abdicate and travel to Hungary in person to offer his service in the army unless the government offered something more than warm words of support."
 DOD_hungary.23.a:0 "Will they get here in time?"
 DOD_hungary.24.t:0 "Sweden is under attack."
 DOD_hungary.24.desc:0 "Sweden has become embroiled in a bloody conflict. Making a rare appearance before both houses of parliament, the King has noted that he is deeply worried about his old home, and particularly about the fate his father and family should suffer if Sweden was to be defeated. In light of this, the government has decided to meet and discuss what can be done to help Sweden."
 DOD_hungary.24.a:0 "We can't be drawn into their conflict."
 DOD_hungary.24.b:0 "Send covert support."
 DOD_hungary.24.c:0 "We stand side by side with the Swedes."
 DOD_hungary.25.t:0 "Hungary denies aid."
 DOD_hungary.25.desc:0 "Despite a personal appeal by the Hungarian King, parliament has voted to deny any kind of support to Sweden. The opposition has threatened to remove [HUN.GetLeader] through a vote of no-confidence if he should try to do anything that would violate Hungarian neutrality."
 DOD_hungary.25.a:0 "We are on our own."
 DOD_hungary.26.t:0 "Hungary sends support"
 DOD_hungary.26.desc:0 "Hungary has opened their old arsenals and send us a number of refurbished rifles and other infantry equipments. Several thousand Hungarian volunteers have also made their way to us."
 DOD_hungary.26.a:0 "They are most welcome."
 DOD_hungary.27.t:0 "Hungary intervenes"
 DOD_hungary.27.desc:0 "The Hungarian government has issued a statement proclaiming that any attack on Sweden is to be considered an attack on Hungary as well. The Hungarian Military has been placed at high alert and is expected to enter the war as soon as mobilization is complete."
 DOD_hungary.27.a:0 "Will it be in time?"
 DOD_hungary.30.t:0 "Hungary offers Rapprochement"
 DOD_hungary.30.desc:0 "The Hungarian government has approached us with the offer to renegotiate the Treaty of Trianon. Under their offer, the restrictions on army size in the treaty would be changed to allow Hungary to bring its current army to full strength. Hungary would further be permitted to spend a greater portion of its budget on expanding and modernizing its military industries. \n\nWith a democratic government firmly in charge of the country, there is considerable support for the scheme in our diplomatic service."
 DOD_hungary.30.a:0 "A reasonable request."
 DOD_hungary.30.b:0 "And what would they need a bigger army for?"
 DOD_hungary.31.t:0 "The Revision of Trianon"
 DOD_hungary.31.desc:0 "The government of [HUN.GetLeader] has scored a major political victory, as [From.GetNameDef] has just ratified the Revision to the Treaty of Trianon. We are now allowed to reinstate conscription and can openly earmark money for the construction of military factories in the budget."
 DOD_hungary.31.a:0 "Excellent."
 DOD_hungary.32.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] refuses to negotiate"
 DOD_hungary.32.desc:0 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has refused to budge on the rearmament issue. Talks have broken down almost immediately, with the [From.GetAdjective] delegation stalling at every opportunity and turning minor issues such as the seating order into hour-long debates. It is clear that they don't intend on letting us rearm, but they want us to be the ones who walk out of the talks."
 DOD_hungary.32.a:0 "Very well, we shall indulge them."
 DOD_hungary.32.b:0 "Approach France for help."
 DOD_hungary.32.c:0 "Approach Britain for help."
 DOD_hungary.33.t:0 "Hungary appeals for support"
 DOD_hungary.33.desc:0 "Hungary has recently started to feel out its neigbours about revising some of the restrictions placed on it after the last war. Specifically, they want to reintroduce conscription and expand their military industries. The Hungarian argument is that the world is becoming less safe with every passing day, and that they need a proper military to defend themselves. [From.From.GetNameDefCap] thinks otherwise."
 DOD_hungary.33.a:0 "Hungary should be permitted limited rearmament."
 DOD_hungary.33.b:0 "We can't upset the balance of power in the region."
 DOD_hungary.34.t:0 "[From.GetName] supports Hungary"
 DOD_hungary.34.desc:0 "The Ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has made it clear that his government is strongly against our decision to deny the Hungarians the right to rearm. He further made it clear that should we insist on Hungary remaining disarmed, his government will take that into consideration when diplomatic issues concerning us arise in the future. \n\nIn other words, they are willing to gamble our current good relations on it."
 DOD_hungary.34.a:0 "Let us pray they are not wrong."
 DOD_hungary.34.b:0 "We must be firm on this issue."
 DOD_hungary.35.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses support"
 DOD_hungary.35.desc:0 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has informed us that they consider the question of revising the Treaty of Trianon to be a purely internal matter of the countries concerned, and have refused to get involved in the matter. It appears they care more about keeping good relations with their former allies than in justice."
 DOD_hungary.35.a:0 "Damn them."
 DOD_hungary.36.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] remains stubborn."
 DOD_hungary.36.desc:0 "Despite heavy political pressure from [From.From.GetNameDef], [From.GetNameDef] has categorically refused to discuss the issue. It seems that they are still afraid that we will use our weapons against them. \n\nWith all diplomatic avenues blocked, we will have to wait and see if we will get another opportunity in the future to revisit the issue."
 DOD_hungary.36.a:0 "Are we really that threatening?"
 DOD_hungary.40.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] renounces Treaty of Trianon"
 DOD_hungary.40.desc:0 "[HUN.GetLeader] today publicly stated that he no longer considers [HUN.GetNameDef] bound by the treaty. More than that, he declared it null and void, claiming that it was forced on Hungary at gun point and therefore never legally binding. The Hungarian government has not even bothered to formally inform us of their decision.\n\n Many in the government favor a strong reply. If we show the Hungarians that we are not afraid of them, they will surely fold. However, they might also decide that we are bluffing."
 DOD_hungary.40.a:0 "Issue an ultimatum at once."
 DOD_hungary.40.b:0 "We can't afford a war right now."
 DOD_hungary.41.t:0 "[From.GetName] issues an ultimatum."
 DOD_hungary.41.desc:0 "Our recent decision to abandon the Treaty of Trianon has been met with a surprisingly strong rebuttal by [From.GetNameDef]. [From.GetLeader] reportedly demanded that the [From.GetAdjective] military prepare a plan for intervention at once. Meanwhile, the [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has asked that we clarfiy our statements regarding the Treaty, suggesting that the military option is still on the table."
 DOD_hungary.41.a:0 "They are clearly bluffing."
 DOD_hungary.41.b:0 "There appears to have been a misunderstanding."
 DOD_hungary.42.t:0 "[From.GetName] folds."
 DOD_hungary.42.desc:0 "Despite our strongly worded statements about the Treaty of Trianon, [From.GetNameDef] has not made any moves to stop us. In a recent press conference, [From.GetLeader] did all he could to not answer any questions about our decision to abandon the Treaty. This clearly shows what everyone already suspected: [From.GetNameDef] is nothing but a paper tiger."
 DOD_hungary.42.a:0 "As expected."
 DOD_hungary.43.t:0 "Hungary refuses to back down."
 DOD_hungary.43.desc:0 "It appears that our warning to Hungary has fallen on deaf ears. At a rally in Budapest last evening, the crowds reportedly shouted "Death to [From.From.GetNameDef]!" and [HUN.GetLeader] publicly vowed that any attempt to stop Hungary from reclaiming its rightful place in the world would be met with "a war the likes the world has never seen, a war that will make the great slaughter of 1914 to 1918 look like a mere bar fight".\n\nWe are at a crossroads. We must either go to war to defend our honor and credibility, or accept that we have been outmaneuvered."
 DOD_hungary.43.a:0 "If the Hungarians want war, then we will give it to them."
 DOD_hungary.43.b:0 "They called our bluff."
 DOD_hungary.44.t:0 "Hungary backs down"
 DOD_hungary.44.desc:0 "With the threat of war on the table, the Hungarian government has suddenly become a lot more friendly. Our ambassador was invited to a private lunch with [HUN.GetLeader], where he was assured that [HUN.GetNameDef] wanted nothing but peace and friendly relations with us. Any statements in the sensationalist press should not be taken as coming from the Hungarian government, which has never wanted a war."
 DOD_hungary.44.a:0 "That's what we thought."
 DOD_hungary.45.t:0 "Intervention in Hungary"
 DOD_hungary.45.desc:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has declared a military intervention after Hungary openly renounced the Treaty of Trianon. They have asked us to join them in bringing down Hungary before it can regain its strength."
 DOD_hungary.45.a:0 "We must strike before it is too late."
 DOD_hungary.45.b:0 "We will not be drawn into this conflict."
 DOD_hungary.46.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] proclaims neutrality"
 DOD_hungary.46.desc:0 "The traitors and cowards in [From.GetNameDef] have refused to answer our call to arms! Instead of standing up to the bully in Budapest, they have rolled over and left us to face the Hungarians alone."
 DOD_hungary.46.a:0 "We can do it on our own."
 DOD_hungary.50.t:0 "Hungary demands Transylvania"
 DOD_hungary.50.desc:0 "Transylvania was long a part of Hungary, before its people freely decided to join us after the Great War. Unfortunately, Hungary never got over the loss of their territory. At various times, they have publicly claimed Transylvania as an integral part of Hungary. With the recent shifts in the political situation, they have once again decided to advance their claims, demanding that we turn over the whole of Transylvania to them...or else."
 DOD_hungary.50.a:0 "It's not worth the bloodshed of another war."
 DOD_hungary.50.b:0 "Or else...what?"
 DOD_hungary.51.t:0 "Romania transfers Transylvania"
 DOD_hungary.51.desc:0 "Rather than face the might of our armies, the cowardly Romanians have decided to return our rightful territories. The entirety of Transylvania has been given over to our administration, and our forces have taken full control."
 DOD_hungary.51.a:0 "As it should be."
 DOD_hungary.52.t:0 "Romania refuses to give up Transylvania"
 DOD_hungary.52.desc:0 "It is perhaps most telling that the Romanian ambassador, in a meeting with [HUN.GetLeader] this morning, felt the need to add "as always" to his flat refusal to even discuss the possibility of transfering the contested territories. Time and again, the Romanian government has publicly refused our claims, even ridiculing them. For years, we were too weak to push back.\n\nNot anymore."
 DOD_hungary.52.a:0 "Anger is a poor guide in war. We will bide our time."
 DOD_hungary.52.b:0 "They went too far this time."
 DOD_hungary.53.t:0 "Hungary mobilizes"
 DOD_hungary.53.desc:0 "Hungary has placed its forces in a state of heightened readiness. Hungarian recon planes have penetrated our airspace dozens of times in the last few hours. Our own intelligence service reports large troop movements towards the borders and air raid sirens howling in Budapest. It appears that the Hungarians are serious this time. We might be going to war."
 DOD_hungary.53.a:1 "We made our gesture. No one wants a war."
 DOD_hungary.53.b:1 "They will not pass!"
 DOD_hungary.53.c:0 "Perhaps it is time to compromise."
 DOD_hungary.54.t:0 "Romania mobilizes"
 DOD_hungary.54.desc:0 "In response to our military preparations, [ROM.GetLeader] has signed General Order No. 1, putting the Romanian military on highest alert. The Romanian Air Force has occupied its war stations, and their fighters have engaged ours in mock dogfights. The Romanian ambassador has asked for his passport. No shots have been fired yet, but it is only a question of time before this crisis explodes into war. \n\nOur ambassadors in Britain, France and Germany report feverish activity in their respective forign offices, indicating that these nations might take an interest in the brewing crisis. If we wish to solve this by force, we must strike quickly."
 DOD_hungary.54.a:0 "This is spiraling out of control."
 DOD_hungary.54.b:0 "Then war it is."
 DOD_hungary.54.c:0 "Offer to accept impartial mediation."
 DOD_hungary.55.t:0 "Choose a Mediator"
 DOD_hungary.55.desc:0 "Despite the high tensions, there is still a chance to solve the issue through diplomacy. The other side has approached us through back channels, suggesting that they would not necessarily be against a commission of uninvolved nations to decide the issue. Who should we approach to argue our case?"
 DOD_hungary.55.a:0 "Approach Germany"
 DOD_hungary.55.b:0 "Approach Britain"
 DOD_hungary.55.d:0 "Approach France"
 DOD_hungary.55.c:0 "Approach the Soviet Union"
 DOD_hungary.55.e:0 "Approach Italy"
 DOD_hungary.55.f:1 "There is no one willing to hear our case..."
 DOD_hungary.57.t:0 "Hungary backs down"
 DOD_hungary.57.desc:0 "Despite the harsh rhetoric still coming out of Budapest, Hungarian forces near the border have retreated. Violations of our airspace have ceased. It appears that [HUN.GetLeader] wants to keep this as quiet as possible, and there is consensus in the foreign office that he should be allowed to do so. A gesture of reconciliation is a small price to pay when we have so narrowly avoided a war."
 DOD_hungary.57.a:0 "A triumph."
 DOD_hungary.58.t:0 "Hungary seeks Mediation"
 DOD_hungary.58.desc:0 "With the situation in the Balkans quickly moving towards all-out warfare, Hungary has decided to ask for mediation of the Transylvanian dispute. They have approached us to request that we sit on the commission to decide the fate of Transylvania. They clearly believe that we will argue their case in the upcoming conference."
 DOD_hungary.58.a:0 "We will gladly do so."

 DOD_hungary.59.t:0 "Romania seeks Mediation"
 DOD_hungary.59.desc:0 "Faced with increasing pressure from Hungary, Romania has asked for an impartial commission to decide the dispute over Transylvania.

 DOD_hungary.60.t:0 "The Balkan Crisis"
 DOD_hungary.60.desc:0 "Over the last few days, the tense relations between Hungary and Romania have broken down completely. Hungary has demanded Romania turn over the contested territories of Transylvania to them. Romania has refused. Both sides have now mobilized their forces, and war in the region seems inevitable.\n\nThe Foreign Office believes it to be imperative that we prepare an intervention to defend our interests in the region. there is also a chance that the mere threat of us getting involved will bring the other side to the negotiation table."

Particularly the oil wells of Ploesti are very important to [From.GetNameDef]. Should Transylvania fall to us, or if we should try and occupy Romania as a whole, the oil supply would be greatly endangered. The [From.GetAdjective] government is evidently unwilling to accept the risk, and has gone so far as to threaten a military intervention on the side of Romania if war were to break out."

 czech.22.d:1 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has offered up the Sudetenland as a step towards coming to a mutual understanding. On one hand, this is a great opportunity to acquire a rich state for little cost and with little danger.

 czech.24.d:2 "[From.GetLeader] has refused our offer to hand over the Sudetenland. He did not give any reason for this move, but the [From.GetAdjective] decision has sent a shockwave through the military, who believes the Germans might have bigger plans for us."

 czech.27.d:2 "While [From.GetLeader] agreed to meet our delegation, he has so far refused to commit his country to join the Entente. The [From.GetAdjective]s seem to be worried that joining our alliance might destabilize the careful balance of power in the region."

 czech.32.d:2 "The Entente lead by [From.GetNameDef] has long been aimed at containing our nation. However, as German power grows, [From.GetNameDef] feels increasingly threatened from that direction. unwilling to face a threat on two sides, [From.GetLeader] now seeks to come to an understanding with us. \n\nOur government is split on the issue. One faction believes that an agreement with [From.GetNameDef] is the first step to breaking the encirclement, while the other faction points to the fact that this would no doubt draw the wrath of [GER.GetLeader]."
 czech.32.a:1 "We accept their offer."
 czech.32.b:0 "Never!"
 czech.33.d:2 "[From.GetLeader] was surprisingly open to our offer. We have signed a Treaty of Mutual Friendship, affirming that neither of us has any territorial claims on the other."

Addressing the Chiefs of Staff and the Cabinet with a lengthy, albeit rather slurred monologue, he appealed to their most delicate and heart-felt sensibilities, only to finish by solemnly calling for the renaming of two of the enemy's great cities as a tribute to that greatest and deepest of feelings known to man; love.\n\nThe King has clearly become entirely fixated upon this idea in his mind, and he is highly unlikely to budge easily should we wish to dissuade him."
