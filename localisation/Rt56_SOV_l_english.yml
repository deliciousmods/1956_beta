 r56.soviet.1.d:0 "Gosplan is happy to report to the Central Committee that the current five year plan is still currently ahead of schedule! Last year we’ve made huge strides in our Steel Production. Surpassing many other Countries in production. We’ve also increased our Oil and Coal production over last years totals.\nGosplan is revolutionizing our great nation from a rural peasantry, to a industrial powerhouse rivaling those Capitalist bastards in the west! Though with that said, Gosplan has a question for the Central Committee. Should we still heavily focus on production goals or switch some resources to expanding civilian industries?"

The current railway system can’t keep up with the current size of our industry, and the tonnage needed to be shipped through it. Gospaln recommended improving it as soon as possible, again."

 r56.soviet.20.t:0 "Andrey Vlasov wants to offer some additional help"
 r56.soviet.20.d:0 "When Vlasov was brought in for a little sit down by the NKVD he seemed to show great interest in our plot and wanted to lend all the help he could. Though he seemed a little too interested in the details by our agents accounts."

 r56.soviet.22.t:0 "Contact exiled Generals?"
 r56.soviet.22.d:0 "Our NKVD agents have suggested that smuggling in excommunicated Generals and other Military figures that were exiled. This might lend to a more stable post Coup Military. This would also lend to a stronger and more experience Military."

A Trial took place the next day were he was sentenced to death, and hang later that afternoon. Also many officials in the Russian government who were accused of participating in Stalin’s crimes are in the process of being rounded up and jailed or executed. No one knows who will now lead [SOV.GetNameDefCap]. Rumor has it that [SOV.GetLeader] has extend an invitation for Trotsky to come back and lead."
 r56.soviet.27.a:0 "The False Revolutionary is dead!"
 r56.soviet.27.b:0 "Stalin’s house of cards have finally fallen over."
 r56.soviet.28.t:0 "The End of Communist Rule in Russia"
 r56.soviet.28.d:0 "\nAlmost as soon as Trotsky returned to lead the Soviet Government in a post Stalin Era. He’s been upend by a large faction of anti-communist officials, and officers. This faction had quickly formed a large following in the Army and government and have simply done away with pro-communist officials seemly overnight. Some experts suspect that Trotsky’s Purges of Stalin loyalist’s from his government and the chaos that followed the Coup may have weaken the communist party beyond repair. The leader of the overthrow; [SOV.GetLeader] now has the seemingly impossible task of stabilizing the new [SOV.GetName] government and the many factions within it. "
 r56.soviet.28.a:0 "We must now lead our country men to a better future"
 r56.soviet.28.b:0 "Glad that little 'experiment' is over"
 r56.soviet.28.c:0 "We must carry on the revolution ourselves."
 r56.soviet.29.t:0 "[SOV.GetLeader] has called for a world revolution"
 r56.soviet.29.d:0 "[SOV.GetLeader] called on Communist everywhere to unchain themselves and overthrow the capitalist governments around the world, take up arms in [SOV.GetName]'s' struggle to bring about the 'World Revolution.'"
