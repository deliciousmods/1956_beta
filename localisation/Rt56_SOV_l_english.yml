 r56.soviet.1.d:0 "Gosplan is happy to report to the Central Committee that the current five year plan is still currently ahead of schedule! Last year we’ve made huge strides in our Steel Production. Surpassing many other Countries in production. We’ve also increased our Oil and Coal production over last years totals.\nGosplan is revolutionizing our great nation from a rural peasantry, to a industrial powerhouse rivaling those Capitalist bastards in the west! Though with that said, Gosplan has a question for the Central Committee. Should we still heavily focus on production goals or switch some resources to expanding civilian industries?"
 r56.soviet.1.a:0 "Keep the focus on production goals."
 r56.soviet.1.b:0 "Refocus on civilian industry expansion."
 r56.soviet.2.t:0 "Railway slowdowns."
 r56.soviet.2.d:0 "Gosplan is reporting that railway slowdowns are preventing production quotas, and deliveries from being filled in a timely manner.

 r56.soviet.4.d:0 "Gosplan is reporting that railway slowdowns are still preventing production quotas, and deliveries from being filled in a timely manner. Leading to a slowdown in production across the broad. Also that these slowdowns are only getting worse. The current railway system can’t keep up with the current size of our industry, and the tonnage needed to be shipped through it. Gosplan recommended improving the railways as soon as possible.

 r56.soviet.11.a:0 "This is a troubling development"
 r56.soviet.16.t:0 "Missed timeline on our 'Five Year Plan'"
 r56.soviet.16.d:0 "Gosplan has informed us that the current Five Year Plan has fallen behind schedule. While the industrial plan was original ahead of schedule we’ve fallen behind and missed the deadline needed to finish it set by Party. This in turn has affected our future industrial efforts. This is an embarrassment for the Communist Party."

 r56.soviet.18.d:0 "Since his rise to power in 1924, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been constantly working on the removal of any sort of the political opposition to his rule over [SOV.GetName]. Zinoviev, Bucharin, Trotsky and Kirov have already either fallen victim to the political power struggle or were forced into exile and hiding from NKVD agents. GenSek wrath may fall on anyone who is persuading his or her carreer within the party too strongly or too weakly. \n\nNikolai Yezhov has started to fear that his position at the NKVD might be in jeopardy, and that [ROOT.GetLeader] might remove him from his current office or worse. He’s now using the activities that are currently directed toward finding people who are enemies of the state, and instead using these activities as cover for his current plans to recruit Officers and Officials into a scheme to remove Stalin from power."
 r56.soviet.18.a:0 "We must move quickly"
 r56.soviet.19.t:0 "NKVD agents have made contact with Trotsky"
 r56.soviet.19.d:0 "Expelled from Motherland and forgotten by the common man since February 1929, Leon Trotsky remains one of the main ideological opponents of the Stalin's rule over [SOV.GetName]. His preaching to the oppression of the worker class has already made him persona non-grata in [TUR.GetName], [ITA.GetName], [FRA.GetName] and lastly the [NOR.GetName], where he was residing since 1935. \n\nHis recent letter was traced back by our NKVD agents, which then contacted Trotsky and are mow in the process of getting him back into Russia secretly. Though this will take time as we have to be careful not to be found out by any foreign agents along the way or by [ROOT.GetLeader] Loyalists. Having Trotsky back to lead will give our Coup much needed legitimacy and experienced leadership."
 r56.soviet.19.a:0 "Classify the Operation"
 r56.soviet.20.t:0 "Andrey Vlasov wants to offer some additional help"
 r56.soviet.20.d:0 "It was expected that the formation of the Fifth Column cannot remain in secret, yet that the rumours about the plot spread so fast wasn't anticipated either. Our agents report many support offer letters arriving at the Yezhov's office from anonymous sources. The writings of one of the letters was recognized by one of the stuff members of our Commissariat to belong to the prominent young general Andrey Vlasov. He was immediately called to Moscow for a discussion of the ongoing operation to overthrow the dictator Stalin. \n\nWhen Vlasov was brought in for a little sit down by the NKVD he seemed to show great interest in our plot and wanted to lend all the help he could. Though he seemed a little too interested in the details by our agents accounts."
 r56.soviet.20.a:0 "We can use all the assistance we can get"
 r56.soviet.20.b:0 "He might be a loyalists trying to upend us. We can't risk it"
 r56.soviet.21.t:0 "Contact political exiles?"
 r56.soviet.21.d:0 "Few prominent leaders of the Russian Provisional Government were forced into exile after the conclusion of the Russian Civil War in 1922. Their political agenda was unacceptable in times of the communist indoctrination of the proletaria in 20s and early 30s, yet now the times are different with uncertainties of the current government indicating itself clearly. Our informators have met with Pavel Milyukov in Paris and introduced the former Minister of the Foreign Affairs to our plan. After a long evening discussion, he agreed to support our cause under the condition of bloodless revolution without any sort of the foreign involvement. \n\nIn addition multiple NKVD agents have suggested that smuggling in excommunicated communists and other political figures that were exiled might lend to a more stable post Coup Government. This would also lend international legitimacy to our regime in the worlds eyes."
 r56.soviet.21.a:0 "They’ll help strengthen the new Soviet State!"
 r56.soviet.21.b:0 "They're in exile for a reason."
 r56.soviet.22.t:0 "Contact exiled Generals?"
 r56.soviet.22.d:0 "After the conclusion of the Russian Civil War many prominent members of the Imperial Russian Army and White Movement have left the country either in fear of Soviet vengence or in a hope to acquire the former glory and recognitions abroad. While most of them have changed their names and conceived their military experience behind the mask of the natural talent, a few of them were sill recognized by our agents. These included Anatoly Rogozhin, currently serving in the Yugoslavian border police, and general Konstantin Nechaev who assisted Chinese government as a military advisor. Long and tedious negotiations together with a promises of reestablished military ranks and return of confiscated property have swayed their loyalty in our favor. \n\nOur NKVD agents have suggested that smuggling in excommunicated generals and other military figures that were exiled is most efficient if conducted via the airdrop in a low-population areas. This operation will lead to a more stable and stronger post-Coup military."
 r56.soviet.22.a:0 "We can't risk it."
 r56.soviet.22.b:0 "Excellent idea!"
 r56.soviet.24.t:0 "Trotsky has Returned!"
 r56.soviet.24.d:0 "The news of Stalin's arrest and fast execution has reached the Permanent Revolutionary and his bodyguards as they were travelling by train to Stockholm to board the prepared ship and reach Leningrad within few days. \n\nAs Trotsky was boarding off the ship, he was greated personally by Yezhov and a small military parade was organized to celebrate Trotsky's return. Both revolutionaries agreed to take a flight directly to Moscow so that the transition of the power can be conducted as soon as possible. \n\nThe new Congress of the All-Union Communist Party was orgnized, at which the Revolutionary has held his first major speach since his exile in 1929. A few tears of joy could be spotted on the face of Trotsky as he held an impassioned speech stating that the peasants and workers will enjoy the fruits of the World Revolution in the recent future. Trotsky also stated that "I’ll bring hope to workers across the world, as we set the Revolution back on track!""
 r56.soviet.24.a:0 "Long live Trotsky!"
 r56.soviet.26.t:0 "Filling the power vacuum"
 r56.soviet.26.d:0 "The 20-year-rule of the communist party over Russia has finally come to an end. With an old Soviet leadership put to trial for their crimes conducted to the Russian people, the whole branches of the legislative, executive and judicative system lie in ruins due to the fierce purges conducted by the communist criminals in recent years. \n\nThe newly established government is pliable to any sort of the political agenda circling among the intellectual, military and workers circles. With Trudovics being popular among the intelligentsia, the Russian Fascist Party is favored among many military leaders and commanders, while many exiles are plying for the return of the monarchy under the rule Romanov's family. \n\nIf we don’t want to plunge the country back into chaos we must side with a faction and have them head our country. What will be the decision of [SOV.GetLeader]s government?"
 r56.soviet.26.a:0 "Those who favor democracy carry the aspirations of the people!"
 r56.soviet.26.b:0 "Other Systems have failed, we need to restore the Monarchy!"
 r56.soviet.26.c:0 "The Nationalists will lead our country to Glory!"
 r56.soviet.27.t:0 "Stalin removed from power"
 r56.soviet.27.d:0 "Stalin has been arrested and promptly executed by members of the Communist Party. [SOV.GetLeader] walked into Stalin’s office with NKVD agents and put him under arrest while listing off crimes he committed against the Russian People. A trial took place the next day where Stalin was sentenced to death and hanged later that afternoon. Also many officials in the Russian government who were accused of participating in Stalin’s crimes are in the process of being rounded up and jailed or executed.
