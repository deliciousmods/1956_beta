The company from Aussig accounted for more than 60% of Czech chemical production.\n\nBefore the occupation of the Sudetenland in 1938, IG Farben exercised great technical influence on the Czech chemical industry and number of cartels were established between both companies, including plans for synthetic oil factories.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Germany (through newly established Sudetenländische Treibstoffwerke AG) finished the construction works on refineries in Most (Brux) and synthetic oil production from brown coal started in 1942.

The first deliberate mining of radioactive ores took place in Jachymov (then called Joachimsthal), a silver-mining city in then Austria-Hungary. Marie Curie used pitchblende ore from Jachymov to isolate the element radium, a decay product of uranium.\n\nUntil Second World War uranium mining was done primarily for the radium content. Sources for radium, contained in the uranium ore, were sought for use as luminous paint for watch dials and other instruments, as well as for health-related applications, some of which in retrospect were certainly harmful. The byproduct uranium was used mostly as a yellow pigment.\n\nSmall area in the ore region in the western part of the country was in the centre of attention of world powers shortly after the war - the landscape around town of Jachymov was the place of world exclusivity - uranium mining. It was the only place where the Soviet Union could immediately obtain uranium ore and begin development of nuclear weapons, especially after the United States toppled the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Thus Czechoslovakia became the prime source of uranium for the Soviet Union after the World War II.\n\nAfter the Communist party took control of Czechoslovakia in 1948, large prison camps were established in the town and around it. Opponents of the new regime were forced to mine uranium ore under very harsh conditions and the average life expectancy in Jáchymov at this period was 42 years. Eventually, the uranium mining operation ceased in 1964."

It was established on January 3, 1920 and its mission consisted of preparing officers (lieutenants) for all branches of Czechoslovak army. By 1938 thousands of officers, including many future generals graduated from the academy.\n\nThe middle level of education was represented by schools for reserve officers (Školy Důstojníků v Záloze (ŠDZ) that were organized as part of divisional headquarters and provided training and education for officers at the lower command positions.\n\nMilitary specialists were trained in dedicated military schools, including infantry, artillery, aviation, cavalry, engineering, telegraphs, arms and since 1933 also the School of Armoured Troops (Škola Útočné Vozby).

Based on early 1920s design by V. Holek the weapon or its licensed production was exported to several countries, including UK or China. By 1936, 34.557 weapons were available for the army and several thousands were ordered for fortifications.\n\nThe TK vz. 37 heavy machine gun was the refinement of the previously used vz. 35.

Much like other Czech weapons, it also used 7,92mm ammo for easier supply and storage inside heavy forts. A licensed version of this weapon was produced in the UK as the Besa machine gun.\n\nFor some reason though, the army leadership was not interested in introduction of sub machine guns, although a modern prototype of a weapon later known as Samopal vz. 38 existed since 1937.\n\nAlmost all of the equipment was 'bought' (stolen) by the Germans after the 1939 occupation and by some modest estimates could be used to equip about the half of then Wehrmacht.

Czechoslovakia was among the six largest exporters of weapons in the world long before the Second World War.\n\nFor a long time Czechoslovak industry could easily cover both domestic needs of the army, as well as export considerable amount of war material, but when the Ministry of National Defense increased the demand for supplies of weapons and ammunition, the major Czechoslovak companies lacked the needed production capacity and it had to be expanded by building new factories.\n\nČeská Zbrojovka established a new branch in small Moravian town Uhersky Brod in 1936 and the new factory was built within 16 weeks of the initial decision. ČZUB manufactured a wide variety of military small arms, including some of the famous post-war weapons.\n\nIn 1936 Sellier & Bellot moved the whole production to Vlašim where a new complex was being built since 1934. When a new order from the Ministry of Defense came in 1938, it was decided to build a new S & B factory in Porúbka in Slovakia. However, the project was halted by the signing of the Munich Agreement.\n\nThe escalation of Sino-Japanese conflict was a jackpot for Czechoslovak companies, especially Česká Zbrojovka. According to British records, more than half of the machine guns which passed through Hong Kong in the latter part of 1938 and were destined for China, were of Czechoslovak origin (approximately one third in the case of infantry rifles).\n\nFurthermore, In 1937 Sellier & Bellot received orders for 200 million cartridges of 7.92 mm Mauser from China, however the contract had not been completed prior to the outbreak of the war."

At that time, the management of the company moved from Vienna to Prague after a call from the Czechoslovak state authorities. In 1919 the TATRA brand appeared on vehicles for the first time.\n\nThe company was incorporated into the Ringhoffer Corporation in 1926 and in 1936, after another approximation with the Prague magnate, Ringhoffer TATRA, a.s. was founded and renamed to Ringhoffer TATRA Werke AG two years later.\n\nExcept for some contracts for armored cars, the company never really succeeded in any of the military contests and CKD / SKoda cartel almost always secured the contracts for Czechoslovak army, often thanks to bribes. However, this did not stop Tatra from developing its own prototypes of armoured vehicles and even experimental tanks apart from the traditional car, truck and locomotive production.\n\nDuring World War II Tatra was instrumental in the production of trucks, and tank engines for the German war effort and the famous T 111 was born. This three-axle heavy truck with a directly air-cooled twelve-cylinder diesel engine remained in production for the 16 years.\n\nAnother successful design, the Tatra 87 car was supposedly popular amongst German officers during World War II for its superior speed and handling it offered for use on the Autobahn. Both Hitler and Porsche were influenced by the Tatras. Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast, and had ridden in Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia.\n\nMany German officers met their deaths driving heavy, rear-engined Tatras faster around corners than they could handle. At the time, as an anecdote, Tatra became known as the 'Czech Secret Weapon' for the scores of officers who died behind the wheel - at one point official orders were issued forbidding German officers from driving."

The new air force was helped significantly by a French donation of 127 aircraft.\n\nFor a modern nation surrounded by potentially hostile neighbors, without access to the ocean, the Czechoslovak leadership needed to build a capable air force. So was born the motto "Air is our sea". The Czechoslovak government between the wars balanced a home-grown aviation industry with licensing engine and aircraft designs from allied nations. Several major aircraft companies, and a few engine companies, thrived in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s, including Avia, Aero and state-controlled Letov.\n\nAlthough Czechoslovakia was taken without a fight, many Czechoslovak pilots did a good job during the war. They started leaving the country in 1939 to oppose Germany abroad. They went to Poland, Yugoslavia and France. After the war started, they were at all fronts, in all kinds of uniforms and airplanes, helping to stop the attacker.\n\nThey saw their first great victory in the Battle of Britain as part of five Czechoslovak RAF squadrons, Numbers 68, 310, 311, 312 and 313.\n\nFollowing an agreement between the Czechoslovak government in London and the Soviet Union, some Czech pilots went to the Eastern front. They formed the first Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment, whose members were the first Czechoslovak exile soldiers to enter the liberated Czechoslovak soil.\n\nIn the meantime, the Czechs at the western front kept fighting the Luftwaffe. They patrolled the Atlantic, destroyed the V1 missiles and took part in the invasion of Normandy.\n\nThere is no exaggeration in saying that while nobody knew about Czech pilots in 1918, they were among the best in the world in 1945."

Although later some new licenses for modern airplanes were purchased from France and the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1934, the Ministry of National Defence decided that the air forces will be equipped by a single type of fighters, the Avia B.534 biplanes, which eventually became the backbone of Czechoslovak Air Force with 568 planes built in four series (versions).\n\nWhen in the spring of 1935 Germany publicly confessed building of a strong Air Force, Czechoslovakia and France responded by deepening aviation cooperation. Czechoslovak High Command reacted to this new fact by expanding existing three airfields to seven, each capable of supplying two bomber squadrons that would arrive from France in case of war with Germany.\n\nEarly in 1936, a new batch of Avia B.534 aircrafts was ordered by MND, with planes entering service in spring of 1937. The last version of the plane included various refinements that allowed the IV. series to have an increased speed of over 200 mph (320 km/h), and this placed it on par with the best of its contemporary biplanes.\n\nGeneral Jaroslav Fajfr was the head of the III.

As the legionaries cruised from one victory to another, the Czechoslovak National Council began receiving official statements of recognition from various Allied governments.\n\nWhen the armistice with the Bolsheviks was concluded, the Legions started a slow evacuation of Czechoslovak troops from Vladivostok and the last legionaries left the port in September 1920. These men literally travelled around the world before they finally reached to their new, independent homeland.\n\nAfter their return to Czechoslovakia, many formed the core of the new Czechoslovak Army.

He contacted the 2nd Department in 1932 mainly because he needed money for his profligate way of life and offered cooperation on paper.\n\nHe was a high-ranking member of the German military intelligence organisation, the Abwehr, who was also a highly decorated Nazi party member with good connections originating from his posts of foundation member of SA.\n\nHe provided a vast array of significant information about the German intelligence services to Czech agents who in turn, forwarded the data to SIS London. Thümmel also delivered details over "military capabilities, and intentions" as well as "detailed information on the organization and structure of the Abwehr and SD along with "the near-complete order of battle of the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, and German mobilization plans". Later he also supposedly gave advanced warnings of the German annexation of the Sudetenland as well as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland.\n\nIn October, 1941 the Gestapo accused SS Paul Thümmel of tipping off Yugoslavian officials about Germany's April, 1941 attack on their country. They also suspected him of collaborating with Czech resistance leader Captain Vaclav Moravek. Thummel regularly supplied the Abwehr with classified SS information. Therefore, chief of Abwehr Admiral Canaris, stepped forward to defending him as an Abwehr double-agent.\n\nHistorians still debate whenever Agent A-54 was really some double agent 'ace', or just an elaborate ploy by Abwehr to feed misinformation to the Czechoslovak Intelligence and allies. Nevertheless, Thummel was eventually caught, charged with treason and later killed by the SS at Theresienstadt concentration camp in April 1945."

When the war was over, Pellé was experiencing a period of great popularity among the Czechoslovak public.\n\nUnder the General’s command, the Czechoslovak army proved its combat readiness and regained its honor. Pellé intended to use this in his favor when promoting his concept of a permanent Czechoslovak army as part of the Allied army. He intended to reflect this in the new Czechoslovak National Defense Act, which he essentially achieved in 1920 and the first Czechoslovak military academy was inaugurated in October of 1920 with the goal to train domestic high-ranking officers.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, General Pellé led the French mission in Czechoslovakia since the beginning of 1919 until the end of 1920, i.e. for almost two years. As a soldier and diplomat, he fully understood his unique position in Czechoslovakia: that of an intermediary between Czechoslovakia and France. Several times, Pellé backed Czechoslovakia, risking the disapproval of his French superior. He also had personal reasons for this, because he met his future wife in Prague, whom he married in 1921.\n\nGeneral Eugène Mittelhausser replaced Pellé in 1921 and served as the head of the military mission until 1926 when he was replaced by Louis Eugene Faucher that held the position until 1938.\n\nThe Treaty of Alliance and Friendship between France and Czechoslovakia was signed on January 25, 1924, in Paris."

Nevertheless, during the 1930s the three states increasingly adopted independent foreign policies, especially after Germany occupied the Rhineland in spring of 1936 and the French support, upon which the entente relied, lost much of its value.\n\nHistorically, the entente lost its remaining political significance when in April 1937 both Yugoslavia and Romania denied a request by Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, that the entente pledge full military aid to a member that was the victim of aggression.

The question of Lusatia was not of vital importance for Czechoslovak diplomats and without transparent support of Czechoslovak state the unofficial Lusatian delegation at the Peace Conference was not able to put the Lusatian demands through the Conference´s agenda.

They were to be mobilized in the case of war, and were also used to reinforce the army as required.\n\nThe II. reserve was for those conscripts who were not eligible for the I. reserve. Those who were beyond the age of 40, and those who were not fit enough for active service. They were to fulfil the roles of support troops or serving in the rear echelon. Conscripts drafted over the standard yearly quota or those that would be materially harmed by full-service were part of so called Replacement reserves, but technically included in II. reserves.\n\nMembers of I. reservers were obliged to perform several military exercises: first two that lasted four weeks and three that lasted three weeks.

The tradition of these meetings originated in June 1882 and the first “slet” counted more than 700 sportspeople.\n\nSokol flourished during the interwar period and during this time, the membership grew to over a million. Important statesmen including the first two presidents of the Czechoslovak republic, T.G. Masaryk and E. Benes, were members of Sokol.\n\nIt should be noted that this period, nationalism increased in the movement and ethnic discrimination or even anti-semitism was nothing exceptional. Sokol members also actively participated in the "czechization" of ethnic Germans in the border regions and special German language islands and generally share the responsibility with other Czech and German associations for the resulting national hatred between Czechs and Germans in the interwar period.\n\nSokol was almost liquidated three times and was banned by all totalitarian regimes in Czechoslovak history. Firstly, Sokol was banned 1915 during the World War I. Secondly, it happened during the Nazi occupation of Czech lands. Finally, Sokol was banned by the communists after 1948. In 1968, struggles for Sokol revival were killed by normalization and so after 42 years of hibernation, Sokol was restored for the fourth time in 1990."

What started as a small strike of laid off miners from mines "Nelson" and "Humboldt II", quickly escalated to a general strike of the whole mining region along with a demonstration of over 40.000 people.

However, the anti-German focus of the law further escalated the ethnic conflict and was actually one of the reasons why United Kingdom refused to support Czechoslovakia during the Sudetenland crisis and effectively sided with Hitler (Lord Runciman Mission).\n\nOne of the (many) controversies of the law was the definition of so called "state unreliable persons". Such person had a number of restrictions, for example was not allowed to run business of strategic importance or to receive important public contracts, but could also be laid off from employment without any justification.\n\nFurthermore, the authorities were not obliged to give any reasons for their decision in this matter and thus it was permissible to issue such decision without any justification. Judicial review of "unreliable person status" was not possible. All this made the law highly abusable.\n\nThe act also permitted the government in a time of national emergency to impose tight controls on all industrial enterprises that it deemed important to the country's security.\n\nAlthough one cannot deny the legitimacy of the effort to ensure Czechoslovakia can adequately defend itself from external threats, the law stepped far beyond what is permissible in a democratic constitutional state.\n\nQuite ironically, the State Defense act proved an effective instrument for the Wehrmacht after the 1939 occupation. It allowed for the quick seizure of the armaments industry of the newly established Protectorate.\n\nOne German armament expert supposedly called it "one of the best laws on war economy in Central Europe" and "an exemplar of tight organization concentrated in one hand" to effectively control all branches important for arms production.\n\nThe Minister of National Defense, František Machník, was amongst the greatest proponents of the State Defense Act."

The Sudeten-Germans responded by increasing political radicalisation.\n\nThe concomitant ascension of the pan-Germanic Adolf Hitler in Germany in 1933, with his rhetoric of uniting all Germans across Europe against the perfidy and 'oppression' of the Slavs, greatly gravitated the Sudeten-Germans towards racialist and far-right nationalism. Quickly, the vast majority of Sudeten-Germans called for almost complete autonomy or even independence from Czechoslovakia and possible merger into the Third Reich. The leading vanguard of the pan-Germanist movement was the Sudeten German Party (SdP) of Konrad Henlein.\n\nThe peaceful coexistence between Czechs and Germans in Czechoslovakia was always a matter of a relatively small part of the German and Czech population under the leadership of individual politicians. In the tense period of early 1938 waves of extreme nationalism on both sides aggravated the situation.\n\n It should be noted that the concessions made by the Czechoslovak government in late 1938 would be most likely enough for the Sudeten-Germans would they have been implemented before 1938.\n\nUnfortunately, the reforms and autonomy laws drafts came at a point of no return and could not change anything.

    czke.414.d:0 "The Poland–Czechoslovakia war was a local military confronation between the newly established states of Czechoslovakia and Poland over the territory of Cieszyn Silesia in 1919. In some Czech sources the conflict is described as the 'Seven-day war' because of its quick conclusion.\n\nThe chief importance of Cieszyn Silesia was the rich coal basin around Karviná and the valuable Košice-Bohumín Railway line which linked the Czech lands with Slovakia. Furthermore, in north-western Cieszyn Silesia the railroad junction of Bohumín served as a crossroad for international transport and communications.\n\nThe casus belli for the war was the Polish preparation of national parliamentary elections in the area that had been designated Polish in the interim agreement as no sovereign rule was to be executed in the disputed areas.\n\nPrague's request that the Poles cease their preparations was declined by the Polish government and Czechoslovak side decided to stop the preparations by force. Because the majority of Polish forces were engaged in fighting with the West Ukrainian National Republic over eastern Galicia at that time, Czechoslovak forces quickly gained the upper hand. However, Czechoslovakia was forced to stop the advance by the Entente, and Czechoslovakia and Poland were compelled to sign a new demarcation line and the disputed territory was placed under international control.\n\nThe final division of Cieszyn Silesia came in July 1920 as a result of the Spa Conference. In conclusion, the railway line connecting the Czech lands with Slovakia and the territory to the south of it were assigned to Czechoslovakia, while the territory north of the railway line was assigned to Poland. The region under the control of Czechoslovakia was thereafter known as Zaolzie, a name that basically means 'lands beyond the Olza river'.\n\nThe region was briefly occupied by Poland during the Munich crisis and later annexed by the independent Slovak state, but returned under Czechoslovak control after World War II. However, the disputes over the region were finally settled in 1958."

The party was formed in March 1926 by the merger of a group of dissident National Democrats known as the "Red-Whites" with various other rightist groups across Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nIt was distinguished by a strong current of opposition to Germany, which continued even after Adolf Hitler had come to power. The NOF instead looked to Italy as its model, and based itself wholly on Mussolini's National Fascist Party. In this respect it differed markedly from its chief rival 'Vlajka', which was firmly in the Hitler camp.\n\nGroups targeted by the NOF for criticism included the Jews, communists, the Czechoslovak government and the Magyars. It set up a youth group and a trade union movement, although the latter was minor.\n\nThe group also advocated a policy of Pan-Slavism, and hoped to take a joint lead with Poland of a grand Slavic alliance that would overthrow communism in the Soviet Union. They also believed in a corporatist economy with a large agricultural sector. The NOF attracted some early support from veterans of the Czechoslovak Legions.\n\nThe party failed to maintain its support, and received only 2% of the vote and seven seats in National Council in the elections of 1935. It was eventually disabanded and during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nDuring most of NOF existence, it was led by former general and hero of Czechoslovak Legion in Russia, Radola Gajda. In 1933 Gajda was briefly imprisoned and stripped of military rank and pension due to so called 'Zidenice Mutiny' scandal, a failed military coup done by certain fascist elements in the military.\n\nGajda was marginalized during the 1939-1945 occupation and abandoned politics. He occasionally assisted the Czech resistance by helping army officers to flee into Poland and by hiding the resistance activities of his son. He was investigated by the Gestapo but avoided imprisonment.\n\nWhen the World War II ended, Gajda was imprisoned by the NKVD and interrogated under harsh conditions. In April 1947 he was brought to trial for 'propagation of Fascism and Nazism', for which the prosecutor requested a life sentence. Gajda's guilt was far from clear and the resulting sentence of two years allowed him to leave prison shortly thereafter. Penniless and forgotten, he died several months later."

Germans, Hungarians and Jews were not allowed to become members of the government, however, their civil rights would be otherwise guaranteed.\n\nFurthermore, NOF advocated restrictions on big business, cartels and monopolies.

The British mediators were active on the ground in Czechoslovakia during the late summer, issuing their report shortly before the Munich Conference in September.\n\nThe report of the Runciman Mission, in the form of letters to the British and Czechoslovak prime ministers dated [GetDateText], was strongly hostile in tone towards the Czechoslovak Government and recommended the immediate transfer of the mainly German-inhabited territories to Germany. The 2000-word report placed the responsibility for the breakdown in negotiations very firmly on the SdP leadership who used the pretext of civil unrest in some German areas to sever contacts. The report also noted that Beneš’s 'Fourth Plan' proposals met “almost all the requirements” of the SdP’s demands. Nevertheless, when itemising the grievances of the German minority, Runciman expressed his sympathy for the Sudeten case observing that it was “a hard thing to be ruled by an alien race”. Although declaring that Czech rule was “not actively oppressive, and certainly not ‘terroristic’”, the report alleged “it was marked by tactlessness, lack of understanding, petty intolerance and discrimination”.\n\nHowever, should the Czechoslovak government solve the Sudetenland problem before the escalation of the ethnic-conflict, the report of the Runciman Mission would probably turn favourably for Czech side and thus United Kingdom and France would be more willing back up Czechoslovakia against potential Hitler's aggression."

Accordingly, party programs and policies were directed from the top, and resolutions of higher organs were unconditionally binding on all lower organs and individual party members. In theory, policy matters were freely and openly discussed at congresses, conferences and membership meetings and in the party press. In practice, however, these discussions merely reflected decisions made by a small contingent of top party officials.\n\nIn 1929 Klement Gottwald became the Secretary General of the party after the purging from it of various oppositional elements some of whom allied themselves to Leon Trotsky and the International Left Opposition.\n\nIn 1935 parliamentary election party held its original 30 mandates with little over 10% votes. However, the events of 1938 resulted in the party being banned, but it continued to exist as an underground organization.\n\nDuring World War II many KSC leaders sought refuge in the Soviet Union, where they prepared to broaden the party's power base once the war ended.

    czke.8.d:0 "The former President of the Supreme Administration Court, Dr. Emil Hácha, was on [GetDateText] chosen by the National Assembly as the successor of Edvard Beneš as the President of Czechoslovakia. He was chosen because of his Catholicism, conservatism and lack of involvement in any of the governments that had led to the disastrous partition of the country.\n\nHe remained in the Office even after establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, however, was a mere puppet and lost most of his political influence, especially after assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in June 1942."

  CZKE_new_airplane_prototypes_desc:0 "The standard Czechoslovak pursuit plane was the Avia B-534 which was one of the last biplane fighters in operational use and perhaps also one of the best ever produced.\n\nHowever, during the critical years before WW2, a monoplane project was initiated in Avia."

    czke.223.t:0 "Czechoslovak pre-war fighter aircraft prototypes"
    czke.223.d:0 "By 1936 it was clear to the Czechoslovak High Command, that the biplane fleet of the Czechoslovak Air Force will need modern monoplanes, should it ever come to war with Germany. Thus a new modernization program was initiated and a set of strict requirements and specifications was set for both fighters and bombers.\n\nThe best known example of Czech modern monoplane design was the Avia B.35 prototype, which eventually entered production as Avia B.135 in 1939. The plane, very similar to Hawker Hurricane, featured retractable undercarriage and a standard armament of one 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub and two 7.92 mm machine guns in the wings. Avia engineers planned to replace the insufficient Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine with a stronger one, but the war prevented any modernization of the plane.\n\nAnother of the more interesting and promising designs was the Praga E-51, developed by ČKD Praga. It was a reconnaissance, heavy fighter that could also act as a light bomber, similar in design to the Fw 189 or the P-38 Lightning. The only known prototype flew first in May 1938, too late to be refined and mass produced for the use in the Czechoslovak Air Force. It was later confiscated and tested in Rechlin, Germany, never to be seen again."

One of the interesting prototype designs before World War II, was Aero A.300.\n\nUnfortunately, the outbreak of the war interrupted development and possible production."

    czke.224.d:0 "By [GetDateText] it was clear to the Czechoslovak High Command, that the biplane fleet of the Czechoslovak Air Force will need modern monoplanes, should it ever come to war with Germany. Thus a new modernization program was initiated and a set of strict requirements and specifications was set for both fighters and bombers.\n\nOne of the most promising bomber prototypes, Aero A.300, represented a modern bomber propelled by powerful Bristol Mercury IX radial engines. It was faster than any other Czechoslovak airplane, except for the Avia B-35 prototype. The Germans captured the plane in 1939 and it was examined and tested by Focke-Wulf engineers in Bremes, never to be seen again.\n\nAvia introduced a new light bomber aircraft, an advanced derivate of the previous B-58 prototype. The B.158 was a three-seat low-winged monoplane with inverted gull-wings, a retractable tailwheel undercarriage and 634 kW (850 hp) Avia (Hispano-Suiza) 12Ydrs engines, which made its maiden flight in mid-1938.\n\nLetov also provided a new design, Š-50. Designed to be a general purpose monoplane, it was powered by two 420 hp (313 kW) Avia Rk.17 radial engines and equiped with three machine guns and up to 600 kg of bombs. It could be equipped with radio station and cameras for reconnaissance duty."

#######     czke.447.t:0 "Autonomy of Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia"  
#######     czke.447.d:0 "The aftermath of the Munich crisis demanded higher autonomy for eastern regions of Czechoslovakia. Two constitutional laws of 22 November 1938 (constitutional law no. 299/1938 Coll. on the autonomy of Slovakia and the constitutional law no. 328/1938 Coll. on the autonomy of Carpathian Ruthenia) replaced the existing unified character of the Czechoslovak State with an asymmetrical model of the autonomy of Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia, but not the historical Czech lands.\n\nA new local government under Tiso was established in Slovakia and the name of the country changed from Czechoslovak Republic to Czecho-Slovak Republic. However, given the events in 1939 and the occupation of the Czech lands by Germany, the existence of this federation lasted only few months before independed Slovak Republic was established as a client state of Nazi Germany."
