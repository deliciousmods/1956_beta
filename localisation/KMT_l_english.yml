However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. [Root.GetLeader] is now calling for a transition into fascism.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by some of the [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but it has angered [Root.GetLeader] greatly. If we do not act now, [Root.GetLeader] may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.10.d_nl:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. [Root.GetLeader] is disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetRulingParty].\n\n[Root.GetLeader] remain certain that the people will eventually pick up their sense of pride, but is hesitating on what course of action to take. Some of the supporters call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
