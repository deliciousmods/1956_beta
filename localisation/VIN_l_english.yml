 vietnam.2.a:0 "Excellent!"

 vietnam.3.t:0 "The Soviet Union Refuses"
 vietnam.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union has sent a negative response to a military alliance between our two countries. Citing in particular that the current situation is not favorable and that the Soviet Union cannot therefore guarantee Vietnam's defence, they have not, however, denied the fact that an alliance can be concluded in the future, once the world situation has changed."
 vietnam.3.a:0 "We Can Only Count On Ourselves"

 vietnam.4.t:0 "Communists Attempt Coup!"
 vietnam.4.d:0 "Numerous militias loyal to the Malayan Races Liberation Army, itself affiliated with the Malayan Communist Party, have just deployed in Singapore, and hope to take control of the colonial government in order to not only destroy the British administration, but also to establish a communist regime.\nForces loyal to the government, stationed outside the city, are preparing to take it back, but nothing guarantees their victory."
 vietnam.4.a:0 "The Coup Succeeds"
 vietnam.4.b:0 "The Coup Fails"

 vietnam.5.t:0 "The Malaysian Coup Has Failed!"

 vietnam.6.t:0 "Help From The South"
 vietnam.6.d:0 "Kuomintang and VNQDD have always been allies, each wishing to follow the teachings of Sun-Yat-Sen.

 vietnam.7.a:0 "We Shall Respect Their Decision"


 vietnam.8.t:0 "Victory!"
 vietnam.8.d:0 "While the last French troops were forced to leave the Indochinese Peninsula, we can easily declare victory. The French oppression is now behind us!"
 vietnam.8.a:0 "Hurray!"

 vietnam.10.t:0 "La Lutte's Leadership"
 vietnam.10.d:0 "Ta Thu Thau, leader of "La Lutte", who had been working for months to organize a real socialist opposition to French colonization, found himself and his Trotskyist colleagues leading the rebellion that liberated Vietnam.

 vietnam.10.a:0 "Hurray!"

 vietnam.11.t:0 "VNQDD Leadership"
 vietnam.11.d:0 "Nguyen Tuong Tam, leader of the VNQDD, one of the oldest and most active parties advocating Vietnam's independence, has managed to restore the power that his party had lost in the past, by rebuilding it after it had been almost completely destroyed by the French administration. The main leader of the rebellion, he has succeeded in taking over the leadership of the rebellion, and with the support of the people, who now see him as a national hero, he can put in place the policies that his party has been advocating for so long."
 vietnam.11.a:0 "Hurray!"

 vietnam.12.t:0 "Cuong De's Leadership"
 vietnam.12.d:0 "While there seemed to be every reason to believe that the Vietnamese rebellion would be accompanied by a form of internal revolution, in particular the birth of a republic, Cuong De, a member of the imperial dynasty and a great supporter of Vietnamese independence for decades, gained the necessary support to enable him to lead the rebellion. Helped mainly by the powerful elites who turned around following the victory of the independentists, the latter has a vision of Vietnam that is very specific to him while being inspired by regimes like Japan, where the latter has managed to gain enough support to help him in the War of Independence."
 vietnam.12.a:0 "Hurray!"

 vietnam.13.t:0 "A Divided Leadership"
 vietnam.13.d:0 "The forces fighting for Vietnam's independence were many, each with radically different ideas than the others, making long-term cooperation simply impossible. Now that the war is over, only one can win."

 vietnam.13.b:0 "La Lutte And The Trotskyist"

 VIN_ho_chi_minh_victorious_desc:0 "Despite all the machinations of counterrevolutionary forces and Trotskyist traitors, Ho Chi Minh was able to impose his authority throughout Vietnam.

 VIN_three_together_system:0 "The Three Together System"
 VIN_three_together_system_desc:0 "The "Three Together System" is the act of sending party officials to live in landless peasant villages, working together, eating together and living together. In this way, we will obtain enough information about the villages to start our agrarian reforms, in addition to sensitizing them to the class struggle."
 VIN_cement_rule_in_the_villages:0 "Cement Rule In The Villages"
 VIN_cement_rule_in_the_villages_desc:0 "In Vietnam, there is a saying called 'Phep Vua Thua Le Lang', literally meaning that the emperor is secondary to village customs and implicitly indicating that national rule at the village was given a way to autonomous rule by village itself. If we wish to maintain the government authority, it is necessary to bring all the villages under the supreme authority of the government."
 VIN_land_reforms_program:0 "Land Reforms Program"
 VIN_land_reforms_program_desc:0 "It is now time to enact legislation that will allow us to implement our land reform programme. The latter will take place province by province, and a Central Land Reform Committee will be established to oversee the latter."

 VIN_woo_the_stalinists_desc:0 "The Soviet Union is our natural ally.

 VIN_the_permanent_siege:0 "The Permanent Siege"
 VIN_the_permanent_siege_desc:0 "We are isolated from the rest of our communist brothers. Mao is isolated in the mountains while an ocean separates us from the Soviet Union.

 ASIAN_PROLETARIAN_SOLIDARITY_FACTION:0 "Asian Proletarian Solidarity"

 VIN_intervene_in_chineses_affairs_desc:0 "Our Chinese communist comrades were also a great help but also a source of inspiration for Ho Chi Minh. However, Kuomintang reactionaries continue to chase them away and repress them. It is time to intervene and save our brothers."
 VIN_invite_soviet_industrial_experts:0 "Invite Soviets Industrial Experts"
 VIN_invite_soviet_industrial_experts_desc:0 "The Soviets were able to transform Russia from a peasant nation into an industrial monster through radical reforms carried out by competent people.

 VIN_create_the_hanoi_group_desc:0 "To make up for our scientific backwardness, Truong Chinh proposed a great idea: To create a large scientific centre in Hanoi welcoming any scientist adhering to socialist ideals. We could then pass on these technological advances to our other communist allies."
 VIN_formalise_the_alliance:0 "Formalize The Alliance"

 VIN_anti_japanese_aim_desc:0 "Japan is a nation hungry for blood, power and conquest. They have subjugated Korea, Manchuria, and soon it will be all of Asia. We cannot allow such a tyrannical nation to continue without being stopped. We will arrange with our Soviet colleagues an invasion of Japan to bring it into the communist sphere."

 VIN_political_reorganisation_of_the_army:0 "Political Reorganization Of The Army"
 VIN_political_reorganisation_of_the_army_desc:0 "The army is necessary to protect and spread the revolution.

 VIN_minimal_socialist_bureaucracy:0 "Minimal Socialist Bureaucracy"
 VIN_minimal_socialist_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The excessive bureaucracy, characteristic of the Stalinist regimes, transforms them into a simple disguised hierarchy. To avoid this kind of drift, which in the long run would lead us once again to the exploitation of workers by the upper classes, the bureaucracy must remain minimal, particularly through greater regional autonomy."
 VIN_immediate_land_reform:0 "Immediate Land Reform"

 VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy:0 "Encourage Inter-Party Democracy"
 VIN_encourage_inter_party_democracy_desc:0 "Despite the existence of a single revolutionary party, it must be open to different ways of approaching and developing Vietnamese socialism.

 VIN_a_gun_in_every_hand:0 "A Gun In Every Hand..."
 VIN_a_gun_in_every_hand_desc:0 "Much of the revolution must be led by the people themselves. To help them in their fight against capitalist exploitation, everyone will have the right to own a firearm and will train their own militias to defend revolutionary ideals."

 VIN_mimic_the_red_army_desc:0 "The Red Army, then led by Trotsky, did a tremendous job of defeating the White Forces. It is by following their example, in particular by inviting some of their officers to Vietnam, that we too can create such a victorious army."
 VIN_a_factory_in_every_city:0 "...And A Factory In Every City"
 VIN_a_factory_in_every_city_desc:0 "Revolution can only be achieved by the workers. Farmers are far too dependent on landowners, and thus will have much more difficulty rejecting capitalism. Developing our industry through public works will help to increase the working population."

 VIN_arm_malaysians_communists:0 "Arm Malaysians Communists"
 VIN_arm_malaysians_communists_desc:0 "Malaysia is very close to us and could provide us with a great starting point for spreading the revolution throughout Southeast Asia.

 VIN_the_vnqdd_in_power:0 "The VNQDD In Power"

 VIN_vietnams_tridemism_desc:0 "The VNQDD was strongly inspired by Kuomintang and in particular its founder, Sun Yat-Sen. Among his many ideas, his three principles of the people are among the most important. What can be done in China can also be done here, so we will apply its ideals in our new republic."
 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments:0 "Establish The Regionals Parliaments"
 VIN_establish_the_regional_parliaments_desc:0 "A good way to help in local representation would be to create a parliament for each of Vietnam's three regions: Cochin China, Annam and Tonkin. This parliament would be just below the federal parliament in terms of power, and could take decisions, particularly on the budget."
 VIN_build_the_quang_bich_line:0 "Build The Quand Bich Line"

 VIN_anti_japanese_guerrila_tactics_desc:0 "The Japanese army may be better equipped, but we know the terrain and how to exploit it to our advantage better than anyone else.

 VIN_the_hoi_quy_toc_desc:0 "The "Hoi Quy Toc" will be an assembly composed of nobles and mandarins loyal to Cuong De in order to help it in its decision-making at the level of domestic or foreign policy.
