SWE_large_navy:0"Evaluate Naval Doctrine"

#SWE_destroyer_effort:0"Jagare"
SWE_destroyer_effort_desc:0"Our Destroyers are among the best in the world- even John Bull feels a touch of envy for them. Technology marches on, however, and we have to stay on top of research if we are to stay atop the mountain."
#SWE_sea_wolves:0"Wolfpack"
SWE_sea_wolves:0"Ubåtsflottiljen"

SWE_osterbotten:0"Swedish Consolidation"

sweden.1.t:0"Sweden Demands Åland"
sweden.1.d:0"Yesterday, the Swedish Government, having already restored their claim on Åland, made the next logical move- they demanded it outright. Representatives from Stockholm have a point when they say the islands are Swedish majority anyway, but our presence in the Baltic Sea would be vastly diminished. Still, the implication is that the alternative is war- and can we survive invasion?"
sweden.1.a:0"Accept the Demands."
sweden.1.b:0"Åland is rightfully ours!"

sweden.2.t:0"Finland Accepts Demands!"
sweden.2.d:0"Today, for the first time since 1809, the Swedish flag has replaced the Finnish banners flying in Åland. While the populace was mostly apathetic, the Swedish government itself, having scored a diplomatic victory and the most important Naval base in the Gulf of Bothnia, was overjoyed. Conversely, the mood in Finland was somber, and it's particularly notable that despite giving the islands up, Finland still retains a claim on them."
sweden.2.a:0"Finally!"

sweden.3.t:0"The Finns Refuse!"
sweden.3.d:0"The Finns have made the questionable decision that a small island chain is worth risking the lives of their people. Perhaps they have a desire to once again be part of our nation- whatever their train of thought may be, war seems inevitable."
sweden.3.a:0"Outrageous!"

sweden.6.t:0"Invitation to Swedish Faction"
sweden.6.d:0"Sweden has been publicly supporting the idea of a Scandinavian alliance on the diplomatic scene in the last few weeks, and their ambassador to our nation has just informed us that they are intending to turn the concept into a reality. While few welcome the idea of being dragged into a far off war, the alliance- at the surface level, at least- seems purely defensive. What shall our response be?"
sweden.6.a:0"Accept Alliance"
sweden.6.b:0"Refuse Request"

sweden.7.t:0"Finland Joins Alliance"
sweden.7.d:0"Finland, unsurprisingly given its global position, has joined our alliance. Hopefully, this will deter the Russians from attempting a reconquest.."
sweden.7.a:0"How very satisfying"

sweden.8.t:0"Finland Refuses"
sweden.8.d:0"The Finns have decided either they've got an obligation to another alliance or they just simply hate us too much to even entertain the idea of mutual protection. Whatever the reasoning, they rejected our offer."

sweden.13.a:0"How very satisfying"

sweden.14.t:0"Norway Refuses"
sweden.14.d:0"The Norwegians were troubled by our alliance proposal from the very start, and seem to have the idea that the Alliance was the first step in a road back to being a part of the Swedish realm once again. How paranoid- that was just ONE possibility..."
sweden.14.a:0"Unfortunate"

sweden.19.t:0"Parliamentary Altercations"
sweden.19.d:0"The Åland issue has had farther reaching consequences than we've imagined. The Fascist and Communist elements alike are taking credit for the idea and saying that it supports their cause, and members of parliament formerly on the fringe of party lines have been abandoning the SAP and other Democratic parties to back their sides. If the SAP doesn't take decisive action now, the political landscape may change forever."

sweden.20.t:0"Norway Refuses Our Demands!"

sweden.20.a:0"All for Nordic security."

norway.21.t:0"Unions push for Collective representation"
norway.21.d:0"The Socialist elements in our country have been receiving support from international Communist organizations, and are beginning to make demands of the government. The Unions, who are supporting Communism more by the day, are backing them, meaning that if we don't go along, we may see more of those horrible strikes we've been enduring for so long. The demands are simple- either make parliamentary concessions or appoint Henry Wilhelm Kristiansen, one of their top men, to our cabinet. Is it worth the risk?"
norway.21.a:0"Make Parliamentary Concessions"
norway.21.b:0"Accept Henry Wilhelm Kristiansen"
norway.21.c:0"Let them Strike!"

norway.20.t:0"Fate of Norway"
norway.20.d:0"The Swedish Foreign Minister recently made a public announcement- the Norwegian Government is not fulfilling its natural duty to protect its interests and keep order within its borders. They say that the only way to prevent foreign invasion is to take control of the military- and government- themselves. They have issued an identical ultimatum to us and have given us 24 hours to reply. Can we fight them off, or must we give up our independence again?"
norway.20.a:0"Become a Swedish Puppet."
norway.20.b:0"Toss the envelope in the garbage!"

sweden.22.t:0"The Finns Refuse our Union"
sweden.22.d:0"The Finns have decided to continue to torture their workers and spit in the face of Human decency by declining our proposal of a Union. It seems petty issues like independence and sovereignty have corrupted their mindset."

sweden.51.t:0"Soviet Vessels Captured!"
sweden.51.d:0"Estonian freedom fighters in Tallinn have enacted a daring operation, capturing from the Soviets one Light Cruiser, two Destroyers and one Submarine in a stealthy maneuver. The partisans hijacked the ships while they were refueling on their way to Leningrad, and now have sailed them to Gotland and handed them over to us. This is great news!"
sweden.51.a:0"Impressive!"


sweden.55.t:0"Sweden asks to join the Allies"
sweden.55.d:0"The Swedes have come to us requesting to join the Allies, seeing the fight for freedom worldwide as more important than avoiding their own conflict. Their navy could be useful and they make impressive weapons, but their military IS rather small. Accepting would be a commitment to securing Scandinavia, lest they simply join us and fall under occupation."
sweden.55.a:0"They are welcome!"
sweden.55.b:0"They're probably spies for Jerry!"

sweden.56.t:0"Brtiain refuses"
sweden.56.d:0"The British have decided they can win the war without us. Overconfident as usual. There was no reason explicitly stated, so we can only guess at the reason for our exclusion. \n\n But they're probably just jealous of our super neat Destroyers."
sweden.56.a:0"Very unfortunate!"

sweden.57.t:0"Britain accepts"
sweden.57.d:0"The United Kingdom has accepted our proposal! Sweden now fights for freedom alongside the Allies!"
sweden.57.a:0"Most satisfactory"

sweden.60.t:0"Sweden proposes a Socialist Union"
sweden.60.d:0"Internationalist Communists in our parliament have submitted a proposal to restore the Union with Sweden, allegedly for the glory of the Communist way- though even our most basic intel suggests the Swedes are backing them. It's unlikely we can take them on alone, given their almost guaranteed support from the Russians...do we fight for one last shot at freedom?"
sweden.60.a:0"We have no choice."
sweden.60.b:0"Norway Forever!"

sweden.61.t:0"The Norwegians Refuse"

sweden.65.t:0"A Deal with Sweden"
sweden.65.d:0"The Swedes have requested our support for their fledgling new Communist government- they're trying to establish a union in Norway. The upside is, they promise to support our claims on Karelia. We don't NEED Swedish support, but it would sure be nice for at least a bit of international recognition."
sweden.65.a:0"Accept the offer"
sweden.65.b:0"Refuse the offer"

sweden.66.t:0"The Soviets refuse our Offer!"
sweden.66.d:0"The Soviets have declined our proposed deal. This is a tragic blow to Communist interests in Scandinavia."
sweden.66.a:0"False Communists!"

sweden.67.t:0"The Soviets accept our Offer!"

sweden.67.a:0"Great news!"

sweden.70.t:0"The King Summons the Government"
sweden.70.d:0"Gustaf V has called a meeting with several top political figures of Sweden, particularly those of the NSAP. He's been concerned lately about the NSAP's authoritarian views, and while opposed to Communism, doesn't see it as a particularly potent threat as the NSAP does. If the King could be convinced of the threat the Bolsheviks pose, it would be quite the boon for the NSAP's popularity among the people..."
sweden.70.a:0"Show him the evils of Communism."
sweden.70.b:0"His opinion doesn't matter."

sweden.72.t:0"Royalist Newspapers"
sweden.72.d:0"It seems King Gustaf has not taken this exile thing with the good humor we had hoped he would. He has joined with a group of dissidents to publish slander about our government! That old fool is just jealous HE doesn't get a seat of power anymore."
sweden.72.a:0"Seize and burn the publications!"
sweden.72.b:0"It's not worth the effort."

sweden.75.t:0"Unite with Finland-Swedes"
sweden.75.d:0"Some of our newly acquired lands in Finland are majority Swedish, and would comfortably be ruled under Sweden proper rather than as a part of Finland. Of course, setting this up would mean a weaker Finnish puppet state if we choose to create one..."
sweden.75.a:0"Swedes under Sweden."
sweden.75.b:0"This is not worth the risk."

sweden.90.t:0"The Regal Cabinet"
sweden.90.d:0"The King has defied Per Albin Hansson's long-standing policy of avoiding any foreign alliance by establishing a pact with Finland, which has opened up a divide between the two former amicable rulers. The King is within full legal right to dismiss and replace him, though this would surely displease the Republican elements of our population. Should Gustaf V carry this plan out?"
sweden.90.a:0"Let the King form his Council."
sweden.90.b:0"Only if he wins the election."

sweden.100.t:0"The Stockholm Communiqué"
sweden.100.d:0"Swedish King Gustaf V has invited the leaders of Norway and Denmark to a conference to discuss our relations, Europe's future, and where our nations would stand in the case of war. Attending would draw us all closer together, but is such a thing truly what we want?"
sweden.100.a:0"Attend the Conference"
sweden.100.b:0"No, this is not in our intrest"

sweden.105.t:0"Operation Stella Polaris"
sweden.105.d:0"The Soviets are dominating our poor nation so far, which is putting us at excessive risk of losing sensitive information- and we'd risk quite a bit if we let any of these important documents fall into Papa Joe's clutches. Our agents suggest we move operations to Sweden, a safer base that's far more removed from conflict, though we will lose some efficiency if we choose to do this."
sweden.105.a:0"Send them to Sweden"
sweden.105.b:0"They are needed here!"

sweden.106.t:0"Operation Stella Polaris"
sweden.106.d:0"An unidentified man in a black trenchcoat met up with our head of government today at the Finnish ministry after dark, and explained in a deep, artificial sounding voice that Finland's war with the Soviets going so badly is putting sensitive information at risk. His proposal is to harbor the information here in Sweden instead- with the payment being the right to see some of the information ourselves, on top of the increased relations. The Russians would never approve of such a thing, however."
sweden.106.a:0"Perform the Operation"
sweden.106.b:0"No, this is too risky"

Sweden is an obvious sponsor- if we are able to secure their assistance, it would be a major boon to our side. Of course, the status of Åland is still in question, and while regrettable, it has been determined to be fair compensation..."

news.903.d:0"It seems the Soviet control of the Baltic states is not as solid as it would look from the outside. At midnight last night, pro-independence groups through all of the Baltic states launched a full-scale rebellion against their Soviet overlords. While Latvia and Lithuania's uprisings were controlled by local occupation forces, Estonia is still under rebel control as of press time. \n\n During the pacification of Latvia, two men identified as Swedish nationals were arrested. The Soviets have yet to make an official response."

news.904.t:0"Second Finnish Civil-War"
news.904.d:0"In rather predictable fashion, Civil War has embroiled once again between Communists and a coalition of Democrats, Fascists, and Monarchists in Finland. Despite broad civil support of the Coalition forces, the Soviet Union has already begun to blatantly sponsor the Communist state, and without foreign intervention, one must wonder how successful they will be in preventing what is in all practicality a coup."
news.904.a:0"What, again?"

news.905.t:0"Sweden Joins Second Finnish Civil-War"
news.905.d:0"In positive news for non-Communists, the Swedish military has declared full support of the Finnish Coalition forces within their Civil War. While Sweden is certainly no match for the Soviet Union, their support may go a long way to balancing the otherwise one-sided conflict, and the potential of more countries backing the Coalition has just increased that much more. \n\n Though Sweden declined it was receiving compensation for its efforts, a commercial vessel in the Baltic sea noted that Swedish infantry brigades were garrison on several islands of the Åland chain."

news.906.t:0"Sweden revokes the Åland Convention!"
news.906.d:0"The Åland Convention was signed in 1921, stating that the namesake islands were legally to be administrated by Finland, but as compensation, the area would not only be granted autonomy, it would also be entirely demilitarized. Seeing this as no longer in Sweden's favor, the largest Nordic nation has once again laid claim to the Islands. In response, Finland has remilitarized the archipelago, and diplomatic relations are starting to sharply decline between the two countries."
news.906.a:0"All this over a few islands."

news.907.t:0"The King takes on Communists"
news.907.d:0"King Gustaf is a vocal critic of Communism, and recently he's made a major speech denouncing the entire ideology and attempting to convince its supporters to instead support the more moderate Social Democrat party. Due to the King's personal sway with several Swedish civilians, many are abandoning the Hammer and Sickle in favor of a simple leftist Democratic party."

news.908.t:0"The King is Arrested!"
news.908.d:0"The King Gustaf V has been captured and placed under house arrest in a shocking and bold move by the Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti. The King was on his way to Uppsala, when his motorcade was unexpectedly jumped by armed Partisans. The King's life has been spared in exchange for a guarantee that the monarchy would be abolished and his family would renounce all claims to any throne- but many Swedish citizens are wondering if the Communists will be true to their word."

news.909.t:0"The King is Exiled!"
news.909.d:0"Revolutionaries from the SKP made a violent attack on the palace in Stockholm today in an attempt to capture, or perhaps kill, the Swedish king. The crowd was dismayed to find an empty palace- the King had already escaped under the cover of night, after hearing reports from his bodyguards of members of his kitchen staff openly supporting the move. Sightings of the King and his family are cropping up in several cities around Europe, and no matter where he makes his residence, one can expect him to continue his crusade against Communism."

news.910.t:0"The Buckingham Gathering"
news.910.d:0"Gustaf V, the former Swedish king, has made his first major public appearance since his self-imposed exile. After a meeting with the British royal family, the King gave a conference with various global journalist in front of the Palace, describing his situation and making more public jabs against Communism. The global community has generally taken his side, and the only response the sitting Swedish government could muster was calling him a bourgeois reactionary, which has impressed few- if any- foreign dignitaries."

news.911.t:0"Sweden and Norway join in a Socialist Union"
news.911.d:0"Sweden and Norway are unified once again under what politicians from the new nation have coined the ''Scandinavian Socialist Union''. Though the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Uruguay are the only nations to officially recognize the new Union, it is impossible to deny that this is a major shift in the balance of power in Scandinavia. If Democratic or Fascist forces want to make a foothold in the region, they now must face a quite powerful bulwark."

news.912.d:0"Though Iceland's population is small, and its thirst for independence is not significant, a small band of rebels, thought to be armed by an outside power, have risen up today and taken control of the entire island. There is no direct proof, at least any revealed so far, but international observers are speculating that the benefactors were either from the German or Swedish government. Denmark has yet to make a response, though an attempt to re-occupy the island is expected."
