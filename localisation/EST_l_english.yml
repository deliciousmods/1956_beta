 est.1.t:0 "Invitation from Estonia"
 est.1.d:0 "Following the tightening tensions in Europe, Estonia is now calling for a defensive alliance between the Soumi-Ugri states. This, however, is not without its opponents. The general consensus within [Root.GetLeader]'s cabinet is that our country can readily defend itself from any and all outside threats. Be it so that the unlikely event of the break of another Great War were to even happen"
 est.1.a:0 "Accept"
 est.1.b:0 "Decline"
 est.2.t:0 "[From.GetName] says YES!"
 est.2.d:0 "After careful deliberation and negotiation, our diplomatic representetive in [From.GetName] has informed us via telegram that our invitation to co-operation has been most graciously accepted."
 est.2.a:0 "Long-live our Soumi-Ugri alliance!"
 est.3.t:0 "Latvian Cores"
 est.3.d:0 "Since we have conquered all the former territory of Latvia we now have the oppurtunity to expand even futher our empire in ways never done before instead of constantly chasing the path of our ancestors. We can potentially unite all the former Livonian order lands to a single nation!"
 est.3.a:0 "Welcome home brothers!"
 est.3.b:0 "It's too costly"
 est.4.t:0 "A tale of Leningrad"
 est.4.d:0 "Following the stunning victory of Estonian forces that the history has never seen before it is now time to destroy the last vestiges of bolshevist rule in Europe. Leningrad the birthplace of communism must be cleared away!"
 est.4.a:0 "Let us chance it!"
 est.4.b:0 "What a preposterous suggestion!"
 est.5.t:0 "The Fall of Riga"
 est.5.d:0 "Earlier today, Estonian arms forces successfully occupied the city of Riga, a vital strategic objective in their war against Latvia. \n\nLocated in the center of Baltics, the city is the key to the Baltic route to Europe.\n\nIts capture puts Estonia in a position to expand the war further into the Eastern-Europe"
 est.5.b:0 "Victory Belongs To Us!"
 est.5.a:0 "Another country has fallen to its enemy.."
 est.6.t:0 "Fall of Leningrad"
 est.6.d:0 "Leningrad, the former capital of the Russian Empire, has been occupied by Estonian forces. With a population of over three million, the city has twice as many inhabitants as all of Estonia, but this fact has evidently not deterred the Estonian attackers.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the city should be integrated into Greater Estonia, since different soumi-ugri speaking people make up a considerable minority in the regions outside the city. This, of course, assumes that the Red Army is unable to retake the city in a counteroffensive."
 est.6.a:0 "Okay"
 est.6.b:0 "Take that, Bolševiks!"
 est.7.t:0 "Communist Supporters"
 est.7.d:0 "The Soviet Union grows stronger by the day and our country is not strong enough to defend it and the struggles with the communist supporters. We should deal with these traitors once and for all and not don't let them arrange another rebellion that took place in 1924. Socialism is and will be a big threat in future if we do not deal with it now."
 est.8.t:0 "Surplus of Food"
 est.8.d:0 "Since the start of the great depression in 1929 with industry and agriculture declining 20 to 45% respectively we now have finally surpassed the level of before 1930's. Milk, cheese, meat and wheat are produced more than used and our economy is growing faster than ever before."
 est.9.t:0 "Unhapiness Among soldiers"
 est.9.d:0 "Estonian armed forces had successfully taken latvia in the last war. Now when we have declared war on lithuania and fought several battles, casualties are increasing and many of our soldiers are wounded. They are exhausted and don't see the point why to fight against the fellow nabers. \n\nWe must somehow solve this problem and make our army great again!"
 est.10.t:0 "1941 Severe Winter"
 est.10.d:0 "This year, winter has arrived early and it brought the lowest temperature of Europe ever recorded during the last 100 years, measured -43° northeast of Narva. The bitter cold has caused big problems for our army's equipment and guns. Our general Laidoner's 1. infantry force reported moderate frostbite cases at the rate of 200per day."
 est.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Requests [Root.GetAdjective] Participation in the Baltic Entente"
 est.11.d:0 "With the signing of a treaty of friendship between our nations, [From.GetName] has requested that [Root.GetName] joins them in their [From.GetFactionName], to unite against the growing threats that surround our nations. Whether communist or fascist, [From.GetName] promises to stand up for [Root.GetAdjective] interests."
 est.11.a:0 "[Root.GetName] stands with its brothers."
 est.11.b:0 "[Root.GetName] can only survive on its own."
 est.12.t:0 "[From.GetName] Joins the [Root.GetFactionName]!"
 est.12.d:0 "Acknowledging the need for unity against the threats surrounding our countries on every side, [From.GetLeader] today announced to the world that [From.GetName] has entered a treaty with [Root.GetName] for the sake of our mutual safety."
 est.12.a:0 "[Root.GetName] and [From.GetName] today stands as brothers."
 est.13.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Join [Root.GetFactionName]"
 est.13.d:0 "In a foolish act of imagined self-preservation, [From.GetLeader] today announced that [From.GetName] will refrain from any diplomatic action that may be seen as threatening to their powerful neighbors. It has therefore declined our request that they join the [Root.GetFactionName]."
 est.13.a:0 "The only safety is standing together."
