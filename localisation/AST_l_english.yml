Earle Page, leader of the Country Party and deputy Prime Minister has been chose to serve as interim Prime Minister until the UAP are able to vote on their new leader.\n\nAt the age of 59, Lyons was complementing his retirement and wished to spend more time with his young children, however the lack of successor lead to the party pressuring him to stay.

Having lost all support from parliament, he has stepped down.\n\nDespite Menzies advising the Governor-General to make John Curtin Prime Minister, a joint UAP-Country Party conference chose Country Party leader Arthur Fadden as the new Coalition leader and Prime Minister. Bitter and dejected, Robert Menzies almost quit politics but was persuaded to become Minister for Defence Co-ordination in Arthur Fadden's new cabinet."
