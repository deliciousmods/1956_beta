Earle Page, leader of the Country Party and deputy Prime Minister has been chose to serve as interim Prime Minister until the UAP are able to vote on their new leader.\n\nAt the age of 59, Lyons was complementing his retirement and wished to spend more time with his young children, however the lack of successor lead to the party pressuring him to stay.
