More practically, dividing Belgium would mean dividing the Belgian Congo and that was in complete opposition with his dreams of greatness. In 1940 he was arrested by the Belgian authorities as a potential future collaborator. Moved to northern France with other fascists, he was killed by his disgruntled, drunk French guards."

This plan however was never implemented as it was judged more important by the government to favor economic recovery over preparation for a war that was still only seen as hypothetical.

He commanded a division in 1940 but he may have plotted with Degrelle to help his "March on Brussels" and organize a coup but I have only found Degrelle's claim on this, so this looks like another of his historical rewriting. Anyway, he was sent to prison like most of the Belgian generals. In 1944, Léon Degrelle needed a real officer to command the "Légion Wallonie", so he looked for anti-communist Belgian officers. Chardome was convinced after he was told that the king agreed to fight the soviets (even if Leopold III was certainly not a enamored with the communist he never expressed such views). But before joining the front he asked for a permission to return to Belgium and see his family. There he saw the situation of the country and probably received more information about the general course of the war. He was convinced that this was not the right thing to do and returned to his stalag instead. Even if he never participated in the activities of the Legion he was sentenced to 15 in prison after the war."

During the war he chose to stay in Belgium because he feared that without a proper leadership, the assets of the corporation would be seized by the occupying forces. Instead he gave his name to the "Galopin Doctrine". It consisted in the idea that the economy has to keep running in order to pay the salaries of the population. Even if it partially helped the Germans, this politics was supported by the Belgian government in exile as it was seen as a necessary evil compared to famine. In 1944 he was assassinated by a group of Flemish fascists lead by Robert Jan Verbelen because he represented the pre-war economical ruling class."

 tblra.164.desc:0 "We are fairly satisfied with the work of Pierre Ryckmans in the Congo, as he is applying the colonial charter quite well, even if some abuses have been reported here and there.\nThe economy is improving, and the situation of the natives has improved drastically since 1909. In addition, mining production and rubber extraction is bringing substantial revenues. Nevertheless, our mining equipment is becoming obsolete and this could threaten the economic efficiency of the colony in the future.\nConcerning the Public Force, it is almost completely disorganized. Soldiers are equipped almost entirely with completely obsolete rifles while the officers are unmotivated. Consequently, only the most basic of security operations can be performed at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, the League of Nations has approved the report of Eugéne Jungers on his work in the mandated colonies of Ruanda and Urundi. The supervision of the kingdoms of Mutara III in Ruanda and Mwambutsa IV in Urundi should thus continue without incidents. Consequently currently see no need to replace the civilian administration, but an urgent revision of our security force is necessary."
